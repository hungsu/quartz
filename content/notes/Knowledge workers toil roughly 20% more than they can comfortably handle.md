Since knowledge workers self regulate their workload, they default to a simple strategy: start saying “no” when they feel stressed. The problem with this strategy, is that they don’t start pulling back until _after_ they have too much going on: leading to the 20% overload that’s so consistently observed.

## Potential remedies

Rather than the common 40 hour work week, knowledge workers should consider a [[5-hour work day]] or [[Four day work week]].
