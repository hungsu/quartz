title: "Typography"
---

The art of arranging type to make written language legible and beautiful. Made up of some smaller skills including:

- [[Font selection]]. 
- Page structure, such as footnotes.
- [[Punctuation]]

Typography is improved greatly with Colour selection.

A core skill for [[UI design]], and in my opinion, a crucial but underrated skill of [UI engineering](notes/UI%20engineering).

Is somewhat related to, but different from Penmanship and Calligraphy.

More to come, until then I recommend these resources:

- Matthew Butterick's [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/)
- Typewolf's [guides](https://www.typewolf.com/guides). If you have money, he has a $399USD [Typography Checklist](https://www.typewolf.com/checklist)  which I'm very tempted to buy.
