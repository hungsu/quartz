title: "Typography"

The arrangement of typed words for aesthetics and readability. Made up of some smaller skills including Font selection, Type arrangement, Punctuation. Is different from but depends heavily on Colour selection.

In my opinion, a crucial but underrated skill of [UI engineering](notes/UI%20engineering).

Is somewhat related to, but different from Penmanship and Calligraphy.

More to come, until then I recommend two resources:
