title: "Typography"

The arrangement of typed words for aesthetics and readability. Made up of some smaller skills including Font selection, Type arrangement, Punctuation. Is different from but depends heavily on Colour selection.

A core skill for [[UI design]], and in my opinion, a crucial but underrated skill of [UI engineering](notes/UI%20engineering).

Is somewhat related to, but different from Penmanship and Calligraphy.

More to come, until then I recommend these resources:
