title: "Typography"
---

The art of arranging type to make written language legible and beautiful. Made up of some smaller skills including:

- [[Font selection]]
- [[Typesetting]], including font size, leading, and line length.
- [[Punctuation]], particularly how to avoid ugly approximations.

Typography is improved greatly with Colour selection.

A core skill for [[UI design]], and in my opinion, a crucial but underrated skill of [UI engineering](notes/UI%20engineering).

Is somewhat related to, but different from Penmanship and Calligraphy.

More to come, until then I recommend these resources:

- If you're a complete beginner I think doing exercises is the fastest way to learn the basics. This [interactive type tutorial](https://www.learnui.design/tools/typography-tutorial.html) is the best I've found. 
- Matthew Butterick's [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/) is one of the best free online manuals on typography. I re-read it and refer to it often. 
- Typewolf's [guides](https://www.typewolf.com/guides). If you have money, he has a $399USD [Typography Checklist](https://www.typewolf.com/checklist)  which I'm very tempted to buy.
- Donny Truong's [Pro Web Type](https://prowebtype.com/)
- [[Gwern Branwen]] has a very [long article](https://www.gwern.net/Design) talking about the design of his website.
- Envato Tuts has a free [39m video](https://youtu.be/yAuUDyUC-GM)
- [The Elements of Typographic Style](https://readings.design/PDF/the_elements_of_typographic_style.pdf). A well-known classic in the industry. If a book seems too old fashioned, someone reinterpreted it in [The Elements of Typographic Style applied to the web](http://webtypography.net/toc/)
