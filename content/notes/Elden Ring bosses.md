## Bosses I can't beat

Bell Bearing Hunter ([Wiki](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bell+Bearing+Hunter)). Tried many times. He has physical attacks that do massive damage, and takes some more Piercing damage. He can throw a sword that cuts twice which is enough to kill me, often when I'm drinking a potion. My best attempt was by using Torrent to jump onto the roof of the shack and shoot him repeatedly, but I still died. A nearby T-rex dog can still reach me, and this feels cheesy. I made many attempts with a great shield and spear, but I run out of stamina so quickly that his attacks eventually break through. I was able to get him to just over 50% HP with my greatsword and *Flame of the Redmanes*, but it's often raining when I fight. Ideas...
- Maybe I need a ranged lightning attack, or lightning grease?
- He has a slow shield bash that leaves him vulnerable, I wonder if I can bait that more often? This guy explains how to bait it https://youtu.be/O_kYg4T8DHU 
- demo of baiting shield bash and poise breaking 
- maybe I can learn to parry?
	- This [guide](https://youtu.be/oKgRvJsNfxc) looks great. But the guide's creator also admits he gets beaten a lot by this variant of the boss!
	- This player beat him with daggers without taking a single hit! https://youtu.be/zt7hyCE1IoU 
	- This player beat him with a club without taking any hits. He makes use of a weapon parry and jumping heavy attacks to keep him perpetually staggered. 
- this guy uses a greatshield and hoarfrost stomp https://youtu.be/aSAmcyAe-8s 
- Overall I think I will wait until I'm after level 100 to try again.


Ancient Dragon Lansseax. The Ashen Hollow did a [video about all the Elden Ring dragons](https://youtu.be/bgW53fwgyo4?t=713), including Lansseax. Only tried once.

## Bosses I had trouble with, then beat

Putrid Avatar in Dragonbarrow ([Wiki](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Putrid+Avatar)). I kept dying to Scarlet Rot. After reading wiki I learned the scarlet rot was dodgeable, and winning was a simple matter of dodging sideways, following with *Flame of the Redmanes* twice to break poise and do critical hits.

[Starscourge Radahn](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Starscourge+Radahn). This took me an hour or so. I died a lot trying to stun him with *Flame of the Redmanes* which takes 3 casts to stun him, and put me in harms way too much. Winning meant realising I didn't have to do much fighting, and just had to keep resummoning allies, while keeping a dagger handy to do critical hits when his poise was broken. Redoing this battle so much was a blessing in disguise, as it allowed me to stock up on *Radahn's Spears* which are scattered on the battlefield.

[Night's cavalry in Dragonbarrow](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Night's+Cavalry). I know it can be cheesed into falling to its death but I didn't want to do that. Ultimately found that using a shield and spear made it extremely easy. It does single big attacks that can be easily blocked, after which I can do a Guard Counter for big damage. It's horse soon died and I could follow with a critical hit.

[Godskin Noble](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Godskin+Noble) on the bridge to the Divine Tower of Liurnia. This took me maybe an hour to beat. I tried initially with a shield and spear, but kept dying in its final stages where it starts to use a rapid stabbing move. I switched to a Misericorde, and found myself getting trapped by its rolling attack. Finally realised if I stayed at the maximum range of *Flame of the Redmanes*, I could avoid most of its attacks with a slight sidestep or dodge, and could keep it stunned before it initiated its rolling attack.

Black Blade Kindred outside Bestial Sanctum ([Wiki](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Blade+Kindred)). It does SO much damage. I got very close, using Misericorde with Flame of the Redmanes and Latenna the Albinauric. This was frequently problematic as I could break his stance, but he's so large his head would clip into stairs or the wall and I couldn't get a critical hit. I tried briefly with a Greatbow, hoping to stay out of range, but that didn't do well at all. I finally won with *Greatsword* using the *Determination* skill which buffs the next attack, Claw Talisman to buff jumping attacks, and repeatedly using jumping R2 attacks. I had Latenna as backup, though she died very quickly.

[Twin Tree Sentinels in Leyndell](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tree+Sentinel). This ended up being a simple matter of baiting one out to fight alone, killing it, then killing the other one. So easy I should do it more often.
