Possibly my favourite [videogame](notes/videogame) of 2022. Also the first [[Souls-like]] game I ever played.

## Why the game is fun

**It's popular**. By far my favourite part of this game is being able to talk about it with friends and colleagues of whom many are playing it.

**It's visually stunning**. The game is so beautiful it is worthwhile to simply explore even without killing a thing. The elaborate and immense scale of the creatures and structures take much inspiration from [Berserk](notes/Berserk), which in turn is a hauntingly beautiful series with a [Bosch](notes/Hieronymus%20Bosch)-ian art style. The game's art style is well captured in this dialog:

> I remember when I was drawing the Undead Dragon, I submitted a design draft that depicted a dragon swarming with maggots and other gross things. Miyazaki handed it back to me saying "This isn't dignified. Don't rely on the gross factor to portray an undead dragon. Can't you instead try to convey the deep sorrow of a magnificent beast doomed to a slow and possibly endless descent into ruin?"<br/>

**It has one of the best Open worlds, ever**. Elden Ring presents options that give every player an entirely unique experience which gives all players something to talk about.  The last few years of open world games have been full of excessive handholding and on screen guides that throttle the player's desire to explore. Elden Ring has almost no guides and both forces and encourages the player to explore. I haven't felt quite so adventurous since I played Morrowind. Writing on games made a 10 minute video talking more: [Why Exploring in Elden Ring Feels So Good](https://youtu.be/qJy8j64pTV4)

**Rich lore**. The visuals of the world and its people are all tied together with some incredible lore and worldbuilding, aided by [[George R R Martin]]. This [Gamespot article](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-heres-the-lore-and-history-of-the-lands-between/1100-6502537/) explains it better. If you have the time, the Elden ring lore videos by [Vaatividya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYDs_Inzkz4) are so amazing they were reposted on Elden Ring's official channel.

## Not so fun things

Despite the lore, the game's story or its characters have been entirely forgettable for me. I had extremely high expectations of the story given its involvement with George R. R. Martin, and could not tell you anything about it despite having 40 hours in the game.

The game balance is terrible. Enemy damage is too high, rune rewards often don't make sense. Videogamedunkey made a [video](https://youtu.be/D1H4o4FW-wA) about it.

Enemy attack animations and range can be so fast and unfair it forces one style of play: defensive counterattacks. Quik Reviews made a [16 minute video](https://youtu.be/YPh0u7WaW64) - and goes on to say [Sekiro](https://www.sekirothegame.com/) has better designed bosses. This person made a [12 minute video](https://youtu.be/R9Vbsr3Ko7M) showing how unfair Malenia is.

I'm playing it on PC, and am aware it runs better on Playstation 5 and looks better on a big TV. PC gamers should note the game is capped at 60FPS.

## Fun things outside the game

### Stuff I personally enjoyed

#### Videos

[[Carbot Animations]] did some hilarious [spoofs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSyRf8rAjTs).

Blaidd voice actor Scott Arthur reads thirst tweets in a [4 minute video](https://youtu.be/PE6wLtf7Y_0)

#### Co-op

Elden Ring has a built in coop mode that I do not enjoy. It requires the host to and joining player to both assemble ingredients to cast a spell to join each other. This is fine, but the game also allows Enemy players to join your multiplayer session and kill you. This cannot be turned off. I wanted to enjoy Elden Ring together with a friend at the start of the game, and we were quickly slaughtered by a level 70 player. In addition, I'm told that co-op terminates when the area's boss has been defeated, requiring both players to cast the spell again.

For a much more fun experience,  those playing on PC can have a more traditional co-op multiplayer mode with the [Seamless coop mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510). Note that it requires starting a new game. Here's a video of it working!

There are two [[Figuarts Minis]] for Elden Ring: [Raging Wolf](https://www.tamashiinations.com/product/details.php?detail=831) and [Melina](https://www.tamashiinations.com/product/details.php?detail=832).

Vaatividya made an art book of all Souls games, including Elden Ring, called [Soul Arts](https://www.tuneandfairweather.com/products/soul-arts-presented-by-vaatividya). Vaatividya also made a [19 minute video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/PWKHO7DYIH8) of the book.

#### Glitches

[[Spiffing Brit]] found that immortality is possible by dying on purpose to the game's first boss then quitting the game. More in his [24 minute video](https://youtu.be/GwBc0ixfbzI)


#### Game Engine

This very smart person deconstructed how Elden Ring's graphics works, and in doing so also also dove deep into DirectX12: [Behind the Pretty Frames: Elden Ring](http://www.mamoniem.com/behind-the-pretty-frames-elden-ring/)

## Tips for winning

Parrying is easier with the *buckler*  than any other shield, because it has the *Buckler Parry*. It has more frames and a shorter start.

[Reddit: I tested parrying frame data, here's everything I know](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/t54kyj/technical_guide_help_i_tested_parrying_frame_data/)

It's also worth observing how others parry, such as this [video](https://youtu.be/i8T2trUiiZY) of a player defeating a boss without ever getting hit

Stagger, and Critical hit. Stagger your enemies by inflicting Poise damage which causes a glowing golden body part to appear. Critical hit by walking up to the that golden body part and pressing R1.

Jumping causes the lower half of your body to become invincible for 25 out of 30 frames. Since it's just the lower half, overhead attacks still hurt you. Zullie the witch explains in this [video](https://youtu.be/8zdbqTHtnr4). Equipment weight also has no effect on jumping, unlike dodging.

## Bosses

### Bosses I can't beat

Night's cavalry in Dragonbarrow ([Wiki](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Night's+Cavalry)). I know it can be cheesed into falling to its death but I don't want to resort to that yet.

![](https://eip.gg/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/black-blade-kindred-boss-guide-featured-image-elden-ring-1024x575.jpg)

Black Blade Kindred outside Bestial Sanctum ([Wiki](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Blade+Kindred)). It does SO much damage. I suppose if I can learn to read all its attacks and dodge EVERYTHING I can beat it?

Bell Bearing Hunter ([Wiki](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bell+Bearing+Hunter)). Tried many times. He has physical attacks that do massive damage, and takes some more Piercing damage. He can throw a sword that cuts twice which is enough to kill me. He has a slow shield bash that leaves him vulnerable. My best attempt was by using Torrent to jump onto the roof of the shack and shoot him repeatedly, but I still died. A nearby T-rex dog can still reach me, and this feels cheesy. I made many attempts with a great shield and spear, but i run out of stamina so quickly that his attacks eventually break through. I was able to get him to just over 50% HP with my greatsword and *Flame of the Redmanes*, but it's often raining when I fight. Maybe I need a ranged lightning attack? 

Twin Tree Sentinels in Leyndell ([Wiki](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tree+Sentinel)). Only tried once. They're just a lot to handle.

Ancient Dragon Lansseax. The Ashen Hollow did a [video about all the Elden Ring dragons](https://youtu.be/bgW53fwgyo4?t=713), including Lansseax.

### Bosses I had trouble with, then beat

Putrid Avatar in Dragonbarrow ([Wiki](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Putrid+Avatar)). I kept dying to Scarlet Rot. After reading wiki I learned the scarlet rot was dodgeable, and winning was a simple matter of using *Flame of the Redmanes* over and over to break poise and do critical hits.
