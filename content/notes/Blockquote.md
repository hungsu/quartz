## People against Blockquotes

[[Practical Typography]] seems to dislike them. From their page on [Block quotations](https://practicaltypography.com/block-quotations.html):

> The reader’s next thought is usually “Great—I can skip this.” So if you want readers to pay attention to quoted material, edit it carefully and integrate it into the text. Don’t just shovel it into a block quotation.
> —[[Matthew Butterick]]

[[Psyche.co]] has blockquotes, with a simple indent and nothing else.
