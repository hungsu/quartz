Manga series and world by Kentaro Miura.

I first encountered the series in the early 2000s as a young teen, in its anime adaptation. I dismissed it at the time, thinking it was nothing special, watching Rurouni Kenshin and other shonen series instead. 

As an adult in my 30s, I bought the first three Deluxe Editions, and have read the first two, each in around a day. There's so much happening in every cell, with every character, every interaction, and I seem to find more with every look. Like a lot of other "dark" media, Berserk chooses to mock predictable tropes such as the Hero's Journey by distorting and disfiguring them. 

The Deluxe Editions are physically enormous and expensive so I will consider carefully whether or not I want to buy them. But I do want to keep reading and see how dark the series goes.

A fan-made group called Studio Taka made this absolutely outstanding motion comic of the first four chapters: [Berserk the Motion Comic](https://youtu.be/I5lLQza7Mew)

Studio Taka also made some amazing [lore videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwyc11QghLo).

Super Eyepatch Wolf made a [1 hour 51 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBrUVqZ_pO8). I haven't watched the whole thing.
