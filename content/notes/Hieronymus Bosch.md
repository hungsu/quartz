Netherlandish artist who painted Christian horror until his death in 1516 AD.

There is an "official" [website](https://www.hieronymus-bosch.org/), and a project with high resolution scans, the [Bosch project](http://boschproject.org/#/artworks/). But in my opinion, the best way to enjoy Bosch is through the [Bosch Bot](https://twitter.com/boschbot), which posts small cutouts of random parts of Bosch's paintings.

His surviving works can mostly be found in Prado Museum in Madrid.

Personally I find his work disturbing to look at, and yet I feel compelled to keep looking.
