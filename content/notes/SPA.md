When you click a link or button, you might see the screen turn white as new page is loaded. Single page apps avoid loading any new pages at all, hence the name. These notes you are reading now are an example.

Single page apps are quite complex, and are generally made with the help of a framework. Some famous frameworks are:

- ReactJS
- VueJS
- [EmberJS](notes/EmberJS)
