Some websites and webapps, load a completely new page when clicking on links, results in a brief flash of the page turning white as the new page is loaded. Single page apps avoid this, hence the name. These notes you are reading now are an example.

Single page apps are quite complex, and are generally made with the help of a framework. Some famous frameworks are:

- ReactJS
- VueJS
- [EmberJS](notes/EmberJS)
