We live in an age of Knowledge work rather than physical labour. In this age, I believe the keys to personal knowledge management are:
- **Search**. When search is fast, it enables flow state. When search is slow or untrustworthy, people are forced to fumble through folders for information instead.
- **Good titles**. No one can find their information again if everything is called *Untitled*. I have some [advice for writing better note titles](notes/Advice%20for%20writing%20better%20note%20titles).
- **Note aliases**. There may be multiple suitable titles for a note, and a good PKM system should allow all of them. This enables much more reliable searching.
- **Links** to relevant notes, preferably also with [[Backlink]]s.
