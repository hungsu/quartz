A link that allows you to go visit sources that link to the file you are currently looking at.

Called a *Linked Mention* by [[Obsidian]], similar to how social media notifies an account when it is Mentioned.

[[Less Wrong]] calls them [Pingbacks](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FvTc37vCGZQZdMWoz/site-update-subscriptions-bookmarks-and-pingbacks#gzbeSrCwaXyzo9Nkq)
