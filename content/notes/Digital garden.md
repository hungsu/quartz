A digital garden is very similar to a blog.

- Both are available on the public internet for anyone to see
- Written by a single person (most of the time)

But digital gardens have a few differences:

- All notes are permanently a work in progress. Blogs prefer the philosophy of keeping a post exactly the same after it is published, and if it is changed, a very prominent addendum should be added. Digital gardens don't bother.
- Organised with Links. A digital garden rarely has a chronological view which is the backbone of a blog. Instead, a digital garden favours Links from one post to another as a way to get around.
- Digital gardens almost never have ads or sponsorships.

The term digital garden refers to the real world metaphor of gardening. Notes tend to begin as rough scrappy notes that need to be delicately tended to, like Seedlings. If you do not quickly refine your note into something more useful, you forget what it means and it dies, just like a seedling 🌱. As you tend to a note by writing in it, you form threads of thought, like branches, forming a tree 🌳. A robust tree, when re-read, can lead to you thinking of new ideas, or fruit 🍎. From these fruit you plant new seedlings, and the cycle continues.
