A digital garden is very similar to a blog.

- Both are available on the public internet for anyone to see
- Written by a single person (most of the time)

But digital gardens have a few differences:

- All notes are permanently a work in progress. Blogs prefer the philosophy of keeping a post exactly the same after it is published, and if it is changed, a very prominent addendum should be added. Digital gardens don't bother.
- Organised with Links. A digital garden rarely has a chronological view which is the backbone of a blog. Instead, a digital garden favours Links from one post to another as a way to get around.
- Digital gardens almost never have ads or sponsorships.
