title: "My note organisation system"

I believe fervently that a good PKM system needs the following:

- **A default place** for new notes. When you want to write something down, you should not need to think about *where* to write, you should just write. My journal is my default place. 
- **Search**. When search is fast, it enables flow state. When search is slow or untrustworthy, people are forced to fumble through folders for information instead. Slow search is why I left Evernote. Bad search is why I avoid Confluence.
- **Good titles**. No one can find their information again if everything is called *Untitled*. I have some [advice for writing better note titles](notes/Advice%20for%20writing%20better%20note%20titles).
- **Note aliases**. There may be multiple suitable titles for a note, and a good PKM system should allow all of them. This enables much more reliable searching.
- **Links** to relevant notes, preferably also with [backlinks](notes/Backlink.md). There are many reasons why [you should link your notes](notes/You%20should%20link%20your%20notes)!
