title: "Backup"
---
A copy of something, stored away from the original. When the original is lost, the copy can fill its place. 

## Why make backups
Accidents happen to everyone. Here are some accidents that have destroyed my data over the years:

- Lost. Old videotapes and photos are simply lost and I've no idea where to find them
- Stolen. Thieves broke a window of our car to steal a camera inside
- Hard disk failure
- RAID controller failure

Here are some I have heard happen to others:

- Account closed or deleted with no recourse. Seems common with Google accounts that post Youtube videos.
- Deletion. Most famously, Pixar accidentally deleted Toy Story 2 and had to recover it from an employee on maternity leave[^1]
- Ransomware - Hackers encrypt files and demanded money to decrypt them

## Other's thoughts

Some people ask: [What's the most stable form of digital storage?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31149427)
- Ink printed on paper (not laser printed)
- Optical media such as CD's, copied every few years
