title: "Backups that work"
---

You likely know what a backup is: a copy of something, stored away from the original. When the original is lost, the copy can fill its place.

## Why make backups
Accidents happen to everyone. Here are some accidents that have destroyed my data over the years:

- Lost. Old videotapes and photos are simply lost and I've no idea where to find them
- Stolen. Thieves broke a window of our car to steal a camera inside
- Hard disk failure
- RAID controller failure

Here are some I have heard happen to others:

- Account closed or deleted with no recourse. Seems common with Google accounts that post Youtube videos.
- Deletion. Most famously, an employee at Pixar accidentally deleted Toy Story 2. An employee on maternity leave happened to have a copy[^1]
- Ransomware - Hackers encrypt files and demanded money to decrypt them[^2]

## Backups that don't work
Any backup is better than none at all. But often, backups are flawed in risky ways.

- Backups that are never tested. It's common for people to make backups, and realise on attempting to restore them that they don't work.
- Backups that take more than 2 days to restore. It's common for people to use strange media types for their backups, and find that restoring them takes a long time.
- Backups that perish. All media types degrade over time. USB flash drives can last up to 10 years. DVDs on a home disc-burner last up to 15 years.[^3] But note that DVD readers only live 2-10 years.
- Backups that are lost. USB flash drives are notorious for this. But also, cloud storage accounts can have lost credentials, or a payment method that stops working.
