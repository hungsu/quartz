Videogames are a special kind of experience. They can be artistic, social. They can be aggravating and toxic.

The first videogame I ever played was likely a Pac-Man rip-off when I was around 4 years old, on the family [computer](notes/computer).

The game I've spent the most hours on by far is DotA 2, which I can also partially thank for my move to the USA.

These days I'm playing games like [[Elden Ring]].
