title: "Computer"

The first computer I ever used would have been on my family's 486DX-33 beige computer running a mighty 33Mhz on a single thread and 8 megabytes of RAM, connected to a beige 14" CRT monitor capable of 320×240 pixel resolution.

The computer I'm typing this on is an ASUS 13" laptop running at 3.3GHz on 16 threads and has 16GB of RAM. The built in display is 1920×1200 pixels.

The only things that haven't changed are the monitors both refreshing at 120Hz, and both computers had 3.5mm headphone jacks. I'm not sure how much longer that will last.
