The first computer I ever used would have been on my family's 486DX-33 beige computer, sometime around 1991. It ran a mighty 33Mhz on a single thread and 8 megabytes of RAM. It was connected to a beige 14" CRT monitor capable of 320×240 pixel resolution. I don't have any photos of it, but it looked a lot like the photo above.

The computer I'm typing this on in 2022 is an ASUS 13" laptop running at 3.3GHz on 16 threads and has 16 gigabytes of RAM. The built in flat display is 1920×1200 pixels.

The only things that are still the same in both computers are:

- x86 instructions
- 3.5mm audio jacks

With the success of M1 laptops and bluetooth earphones I'm not sure how long those will last.
