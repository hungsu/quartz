Possibly the best value electric [[Scooter]] around.

I discovered this scooter through Unbox Therapy and their [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzR16X7rGs0). A short while later I saw it on sale on Amazon for just &dollar;642USD including taxes and delivery, so I snapped it up. (it's back to &dollar;799USD at time of writing)

## Reasons I like it

- Regenerative braking AND disc brakes on both wheels
- Brake lights
- Huge deck
- Excellent folding mechanism to fit in car or carry up stairs
- You have to kick off before the throttle will work. This means you can't accidentally press the throttle while standing around
- Not too heavy, weighs as much as 1.5 corgis, 45 pounds
- Maintains speed as battery drains

## Things that weird me out

- Installing an app on your phone is **required** to unlock top speed. Others have had the novel idea to use a burner phone to install the app.[^1]
- No way to lock it - I have to bring it with me when I reach my destination. This isn't too bad, such as when grocery shopping I can fold it and place under the shopping trolley.
- When starting the scooter, you have to kick off quite hard. Sometimes I have to kick off twice.
- Can't ride in the rain. With just IP54 dirt and water resistance, the manual warns it cannot ride in more than 2cm of water.

Overall I'm super pleased with this - in terms of raw cost it's similar in cost to my 6700 XT graphics card, but arguably gives much more joy.
