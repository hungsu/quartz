A Software Design Document or Architecture Document is a piece of [[Technical writing]] that defines a plan for solving a problem with software. It is necessary because software is so complex and requires so many decisions and trade-offs, it cannot be inferred from reading source code.

Should be written by project lead, for projects that take 1 engineer month or more. 

Should be read by future maintainers.

## Examples of great documents

- [Audacity](http://aosabook.org/en/audacity.html)
- [Git](http://aosabook.org/en/git.html)
- [Selenium](http://aosabook.org/en/selenium.html)
- Stack Overflow, on [Nick Craver's blog](https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/). Beware, this was written *after* Stack Overflow was made, and architecture documents are generally written before a project starts. Thus, you should read additional documents

## Guides to writing architecture documents

The open source arc42's [arc42 document framework](https://docs.arc42.org/home/) is considered by many to be the best. Features many examples and is entirely free to use.
