A Software Design Document or Architecture Document is a piece of [[Technical writing]] that defines a plan for solving a problem with software. It is necessary because software is so complex and requires so many decisions and trade-offs, it cannot be inferred from reading source code.

Should be written by project lead, for projects that take 1 engineer month or more.[^1]

Note that designing a very complex system entirely upfront and expecting it to work generally guarantees failure. Instead, very complex systems that work will emerge over time from simpler systems that work.

## Examples of great documents

Beware, all these examples were written *after* the software was made, and architecture documents are generally written before a project starts. Real architecture documents made for planning are generally kept secret.

## Components of a design document

### A convenient location and format

Future maintainers will want to read it. Thus it's worth placing it somewhere they can easily read it. One recommendation is to make a file called `ARCHITECTURE.md` in the software repository, adjacent to its `README.md`. [^2]

### Dependencies

Significant files and modules should be mentioned by name, but not linked directly as such links can expire. Searching for the name encourages future maintainers to explore.

### Invariants or exclusions

If you have intentionally excluded something from the design, that thing should be defined along with the reason why. Future maintainers cannot know why something doesn't exist.[^3]

### Diagrams

These might be based on the C4 model: context, containers, components, code. Personally I prefer to rename context to *customers*. InfoQ has a [guide to the C4 model](https://www.infoq.com/articles/C4-architecture-model/).

## Guides to writing architecture documents

The open source [arc42 document framework](https://docs.arc42.org/home/) is considered by many to be the best. Features many examples and is entirely free to use. InnoQ has a [guide to using the framework](https://www.innoq.com/en/blog/brief-introduction-to-arc42/).

Free Code Camp has a guide: [How to write a good software design doc](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-software-design-document-66fcf019569c/)

[^1]: "As a general rule of thumb, if you are working on a project that might take 1 engineer-month or more, you should write a design doc. But don’t stop there — a lot of smaller projects could benefit from a mini design doc too." [How to write a good software design doc](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-software-design-document-66fcf019569c/)
[^2]: "If you maintain an open-source project in the range of 10k-200k lines of code, I strongly encourage you to add an `ARCHITECTURE` document next to `README` and `CONTRIBUTING`." [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://matklad.github.io//2021/02/06/ARCHITECTURE.md.html)
[^3]: "Explicitly call-out architectural invariants. Often, important invariants are expressed as an _absence_ of something, and it’s pretty hard to divine that from reading the code. Think about a common example from web development: nothing in the model layer specifically doesn’t depend on the views." [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://matklad.github.io//2021/02/06/ARCHITECTURE.md.html)
