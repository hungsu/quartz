An awesome GPU, released in 2021 on a 7nm process . I bought this to replace my ageing R9 285, a GPU released in 2014 on a 28nm process.

At the time I acquired it (2022-07-22), it was one of the most powerful GPUs in the world per-watt, and gave slightly more FPS than the much more popular [[RTX 3060 TI]].[^1]
