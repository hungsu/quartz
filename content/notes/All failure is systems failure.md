It is common to blame or praise a person's *character* for their current state. It is more useful for all involved to point out and redesign the systems that enabled that state.[^1]

A person who is obese is commonly blamed as being lazy. Assuming the person does not wish to be obese, it is more useful to say obesity is the accumulation of multiple systems setting that person up. Possibly including but not limited to:

-   Increasing availability of junk food and drinks in the person's home
-   The person's growing appetite over time
-   The person's knowledge of nearby junk food, and no knowledge of available healthy food
-   The use of large plates and bowls, even buckets
-   A culture that enables or encourages many meals and snacks each day
-   Unaddressed psychological issues, with food as a coping mechanism
-   Low quality water leading to a preference for high calorie drinks
-   City design that discourages walking and incentivises driving 
-   and many others...

It is far more effective to analyse and identify the habits worth removing, and dismantle them in favour of [[Habits worth creating]].

## Counterpoints

Some may argue that by not blaming the individual they are "getting away" with bad habits. I've no interest in pursuing this line of thought.
