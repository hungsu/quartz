title: "Punctuation"
---

The characters between words, which convey meaning that words cannot. In English, they can include:

- [[Quotation marks]]
- [[Dashes]]
- [[Mathematical operators]]
- [[Foot and inch marks]]
- [[Apostrophe]]

Using these incorrectly can make your writing look amateur or even more difficult to understand. Using them well acts like a subtle, tasteful sheen of polish.
