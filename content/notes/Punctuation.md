title: "Punctuation"
---

The characters between words, which convey meaning that words cannot. In English, they can include:

- [[Quotation marks]] such as  `“”`
- [[Dashes]] such as `—`
- [[Mathematical operators]]  such as `×`
- [[Foot and inch marks]] `′`

It is common to approximate punctuation with a similar character because the real character is not available on the writer's keyboard. Some approximations I see:

|                     | Approximation | Real    |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Dash                | -             | —       |
| trademark           | (tm)          | ™       |
| Copyright           | (c)           | ©       |
| Quotation (English) | ""            | “”      |
| Foot or Prime mark  | '             | &prime; |
| Inch mark           | "             | &Prime; |
| Multiplication      | x or *        | ×       |
| Division            | /             | ÷       |

But such approximations of punctuation are ugly, even problematic. Consider these two examples:

> "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken."<br/>&hyphen; Oscar Wilde

The same example again with real punctuation:

> “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”<br/>― Oscar Wilde

Foot and prime marks can be especially problematic.
- "She’s 6' 10"."
- “She’s 6′ 10″.”

In particular, approximating Mathematics or Finance characters is frequently confusing. Multiplication `×` with the letter `x` is problematic because in maths `x` can refer to a graph axis as well as an algebraic value.
