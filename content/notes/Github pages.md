title: "Github pages"
---
A service provided by [[Github]] for hosting HTML pages. These notes are currently hosted with them, but these testimonials make me nervous:

> I have had multiple downtime with GitHub Pages. I have tried with quite a few and it is not limited to a particular repo or domain.

> I _LOVE_ the _IDEA_ of GitHub pages -- keep the hosting with the source. Simplifies workflows and sync issues. But I find their SSL certs maddenning. They go from working to non working back to working and it is never clear what changed or what the problem is.
