title: "My favourite blogs and digital gardens"
---

My personal notes are heavily inspired by the personal notes, blogs, and [digital gardens](notes/digital%20garden.md) of many others. 

## The ones I love the most

- [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) by [[Andy Matuschak]]  is extremely enjoyable to read. He writes short notes that are easy to digest, presenting them with the  [[Sliding panes]] UI pattern for you to keep track of where you came from, and not a single ad to be seen anywhere.
- [[Gwern Branwen]]'s [essays](https://www.gwern.net/index). Spectacularly well researched posts, that have taught me a lot about how impactful and different a well written blog post is than an atomic note, and many other things. Almost frustratingly, Gwern is almost never wrong about anything.
 - [Maggie Appleton](notes/Maggie%20Appleton)'s [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) is **beautiful** and *insightful*. Maggie herself is a UI designer and illustrator whose work you have likely seen before, and thus her site features gorgeous [typography](notes/typography) and charming illustrations throughout.
