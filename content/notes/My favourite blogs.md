title: "My favourite blogs and digital gardens"
---

My personal notes are heavily inspired by the personal notes, blogs, and [digital gardens](notes/digital%20garden.md) of many others. 

## The ones I love the most

- [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) by [[Andy Matuschak]]  is extremely enjoyable to read. He writes short notes that are easy to digest, presenting them with the  [[Sliding panes]] UI pattern for you to keep track of where you came from.
- [Essays](https://www.gwern.net/index) by [[Gwern Branwen]] is a marvelous and unique part of the internet. Spectacularly well researched posts, that have taught me a lot about how impactful and different a well written blog post is than an atomic note, and many other things. Almost frustratingly, Gwern is almost never wrong about anything.
 - [The Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) by [Maggie Appleton](notes/Maggie%20Appleton) is **beautiful** and *insightful*. Maggie herself is a UI designer and illustrator whose work you have likely seen before, and thus her site features gorgeous [typography](notes/typography) and charming illustrations throughout.
 - [Wonderful things](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/) by Scott Hanselman I have read for many years. He posts less frequently these days, but his content stays relevant for a long time. There are a small amount of ads and sponsorships throughout but they are easy to ignore.

## Other people's notes I enjoyed browsing 

[[Anne-Laure Le Cunff]]'s [Mental Nodes](https://www.mentalnodes.com/about)  has an especially nice note about how [creating makes you live longer](https://www.mentalnodes.com/living-beyond-your-expiration-date).

[LYT kit](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/%2B+Start+Here) by Nick Milo is  a directed set of notes to teach a person how to make a [personal knowledge management](notes/PKM) system that scales well into the future. It is especially thoughtful to people with ADHD and overactive organisation habits.

[Public musings](https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/) by Soren Bjornstad has an interesting note about why  [freedom requires rules](https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#NoRulesNoFreedom).

[Petrichor](https://publish.obsidian.md/bryan-jenks/INDEX) by [[Bryan Jenks]] has some especially interesting notes about [ADHD](https://publish.obsidian.md/bryan-jenks/Z/ADHD).

[Brad Wood's Digital garden](https://garden.bradwoods.io/) is extremely charming, with an aesthetic that reminds me of old brown paper computer manuals. [[Brad Woods]]  is himself seems to be an excellent UI software engineer. Anyone with an interest in JavaScript and UI should look through his notes.

[Everything I know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) by Nikita is **enormous** while remaining quite charming. Lots of emojis and links and pages. I recommend that you simply go there and explore, but if I had to pick one note it would be his note about [relationships](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/relationships/).

[Alexis Rondeau's digital garden](https://publish.obsidian.md/alexisrondeau/) is made with Obsidian Publish and is rich in notes. He has an interesting note exploring whether [increased light improves mood](https://publish.obsidian.md/alexisrondeau/%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F+Happier+Through+Bright+Light+(Experiment)).

[[Joel Hooks]]' [Digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/)

[Moby Diction](https://www.mobydiction.ca/notes) by [[David Drysdale]] has a lot of interesting notes, particularly about story writing and [personal knowledge management](notes/PKM). You might like this one, about how [old ideas generate new ideas](https://www.mobydiction.ca/notes/Knowledge%20work%20means%20transforming%20old%20ideas%20into%20new%20ones/).
