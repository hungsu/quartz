A movie by Taika Waititi in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that you can probably skip. I'd recommend literally any other movie by Waititi, such as Jojo Rabbit.

## The good

Natalie Portman as Lady Thor is absolutely stunning.

The relationship struggles between Thor and Jodie were reasonably engaging, enough for me to see some of myself in them. I can respect that a lot, and I hope to do better in my own relationship as a result. The flashbacks of their relationship may be my favourite part of the movie.

## The bad

The aforementioned fights don't seem to be realistically resolved. Problem-avoidance was well portrayed, but the two seem to get back together in a way that was predictably unsatisfying.

The movie feels juvenile. It has energy much like an 80s morning cartoon. Just as I struggle to enjoy watching such cartoons today, I struggled to enjoy watching Thor Love and Thunder. Jokes are somewhat tiring and drawn out with weak payoffs. The Gods are cartoonishly evil. Dialogue and action felt cheesy. The whole movie feels mostly aimed at kids, and I'm not sure if that is done well either.

All this might be forgivable if the movie developed Thor's storyline in any meaningful way. It does not. Unlike Thor Ragnarok which made enormous changes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as adding significant beats to Thor's story, Love and Thunder leaves Thor in largely the same place he was prior to the movie, but with an added sidekick character, who for now isn't very interesting.
