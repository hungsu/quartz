A movie by Taika Waititi in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that you can probably skip. I'd recommend literally any other movie by Waititi, such as Jojo Rabbit.

## The good

Natalie Portman as Lady Thor is absolutely stunning.

The bickering between Thor and Jodie is reasonably engaging and I saw some of myself in it, and I hope to do better in my own relationship as a result. The flashbacks of their fights may be my favourite part of the movie.

## The bad

The aforementioned fights don't seem to be realistically resolved. Problem-avoidance was well portrayed, but the two seem to get back together in a way that was predictably unsatisfying.

The movie feels juvenile. It has energy much like an 80s morning cartoon. Just as I struggle to enjoy watching such cartoons today, I struggled to enjoy watching Thor Love and Thunder. Jokes are somewhat tiring and drawn out with weak payoffs. The Gods are cartoonishly evil. Dialogue and action felt cheesy.

All this might be forgivable if the movie developed Thor's storyline in any meaningful way. It does not. Thor is largely in the same place he was prior to the movie, but with an added sidekick character, who for now isn't very interesting.
