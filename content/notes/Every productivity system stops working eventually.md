One of the most important things to know about [[Productivity routine]]s is that none are invincible. GTD, Pomodoro, [[Animedoro]], Kanban, Agile, Pair Programming, all will eventually fail you.

This means a few things:

- Have multiple routines.
- Find and know the limits of those routines, ASAP.
- Be prepared to switch routines occasionally.
