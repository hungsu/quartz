G'day! I'm Hung-Su and these are my notes, in the form of a [digital garden](notes/digital%20garden.md) 😀 They are of varying levels of quality, but they're all 100% written by me. You might be curious about [why I publish notes](notes/Why%20publish%20notes).

I refer back to my own [advice](/tags/advice) at times, and I make some potentially controversial [claims](/tags/claim).

My oldest hobby is playing [videogame](notes/videogame)s, usually on a [computer](notes/computer), and I'm currently playing [Elden Ring](notes/Elden%20Ring). My life playing games is directly responsible for my present day career in [software engineering](notes/software%20engineering).

I thoroughly enjoy note taking and [personal knowledge management](notes/PKM), using Obsidian and Logseq. I did a [Twitch stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jASsctBxZk4) about them once!

If none of that is appealing, you might want to just browse [all my notes](/notes), or press `Control` + `K` to search!
