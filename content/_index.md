G'day! I'm Hung-Su and these are my notes 😀 These aren't organised in any particular way for other people - if you're lost, you might want to browse [all notes](/notes)

My oldest hobby is playing [videogame](notes/videogame)s, and I'm currently playing [Elden Ring](notes/Elden%20Ring).

I thoroughly enjoy note taking and [personal knowledge management](notes/PKM). I refer back to my own [advice](/tags/advice) at times.

2022-July-07: This version of my notes is live, using [Quartz](notes/Quartz%20by%20Jacky)!
