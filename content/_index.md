G'day! I'm Hung-Su and these are my notes, in the form of a [digital garden](notes/digital%20garden.md) üòÄ They are of varying levels of quality, but they're all 100% written by me.

I refer back to my own [advice](/tags/advice) at times, and I make some potentially controversial [claims](/tags/claim).

My oldest hobby is playing [videogame](notes/videogame)s, usually on a [computer](notes/computer), and I'm currently playing [Elden Ring](notes/Elden%20Ring). My life playing games is directly responsible for my present day career in [software engineering](notes/software%20engineering).

I thoroughly enjoy note taking and [personal knowledge management](notes/PKM), using Obsidian and Logseq. I did a [Twitch stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jASsctBxZk4) about them once!

If none of that is appealing, you might want to just browse [all my notes](/notes), or press `Control` + `K` to search!

July 17: My first [Time timer](notes/Time timer) arrived!

July 9: I watched [Jurassic World: Dominion](notes/Jurassic_World_Dominion). It was reasonably fun, but I have thoughts.

July 7: This version of my notes is live, using [Quartz](notes/Quartz%20by%20Jacky)!
