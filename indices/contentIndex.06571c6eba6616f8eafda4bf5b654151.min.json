My life playing games is directly responsible for my present day career in [software engineering](notes/software%20engineering).\n\nI thoroughly enjoy note taking and [personal knowledge management](notes/PKM), using Obsidian and Logseq.

","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T00:37:36.089014613Z","tags":null},"/notes/Advice-for-writing-better-note-titles":{"title":"Advice for writing better note titles","content":"\nGiven a page within a [PKM](notes/PKM) system, how do we write a good and useful title for it? \n\nQualities we want:\n\n- Searchability. One should be able to find a note again by searching for it's Title, rather than its contents.\n- Accuracy and Honesty. A title that doesn't reflect it's content is a form of dishonesty, and is why clickbait is so hated. [[Titles are a promise of good content]].\n- Clarity. We should be able to parse a title easily and quickly to determine if it is the note we want. Milliseconds matter.  [[Concise writing takes longer to write, but is worth it]].\n\nIt's worth being aware that the goals and process for writing titles for Notes have very little resemblance to writing [[Headline]]s for Stories, Titles for Blog Posts, or Subject Lines for Emails. It in some ways resembles writing titles for [[Essay]]s.\n\n## Guidelines (not rules)\n\n**Write the document**. Titles tend to emerge from the document as it is written. You may realise on writing the body, you cannot deliver on the promise of your original title. Changing the title then becomes obvious. You may also realise on writing the title, that no single title can encapsulate all you have written. This is a good indicator that your note should be broken apart into atomic notes.\n\n**Write in assertive positive form**. ‚ÄúX causes Y‚Äù is usually better than ‚ÄúX fails to do Z‚Äù. For example:\n\n- Bad: *Doom scrolling doesn't make you smarter*\n- Good: *Doom scrolling makes you stupid*\n\nIn writing this way you may also learn to be more assertive and sure of yourself.\n\n**Phrase unproven notes as questions**. Despite my previous advice to be assertive, if you cannot prove something beyond your own doubts, you should phrase it as a question.\n\n- Bad: *Privilege is inherited*\n- Good: *How much ability is heritable?*\n\n\u003e ‚ö† Be wary of question marks in filenames. You may have to omit them.\n\n**Use consistent and correct spelling**. I have been tempted many times to ignore spelling errors, but this will bite you in future when you attempt to use the search feature in your notes. Take the time to use a spellchecker and fix errors. For the same reason, you should use only a single region's spelling. Don't mix American and Australian English.\n\n**Consider characters you can't type**. I am unable to easily type  *‚ÄúGon√ßalo‚Äù*. So my note for such a person has an alias *‚ÄúGoncalo‚Äù*.\n\n**Look at similar notes**. One way to find them is in a [[Taxonomy of note types]]. You may notice interesting and useful conventions, such as *How To* guides beginning with the words *‚ÄúHow to‚Äì‚Äù*.\n\n## Anti guidelines\n\nThese are guidelines I've seen recommended by others, which I believe you should approach with great caution.\n\n**Move important words earlier**. What is important in one circumstance may not be in another. Consider these two sentences:\n- Front end codebases should not use Typescript\n- Typescript should not be in front end codebases\n\n*Front end codebases* is more important in the first, and *Typescript* is more important in the second. Sometimes it may be worth fussing over moving words earlier, but you can waste a great deal of time without making meaningful progress.\n\n**Arbitrary title length limits**, such as \"Keep titles under 10 words\". have been a waste of time in my experience. Yes, it can be argued there is great satisfaction in reducing a title down to a catch-phrase or concept-handle like length. Where we waste time is the number - hours can be lost musing whether the number is 10 or 12, or if a very complex title can be honed down sufficiently.\n\n**Use Numbers**. Some believe that numbers in titles makes them more interesting and assertive. I believe them to be clickbait-y and low class. Consider these examples:\n\n- 73 thoughts I had while watching Game of Thrones\n- 11 ways to build muscle and lose fat\n- Read faster in just 5 steps\n\nThey have some advantages, namely that they give you some idea of how large the note is. On the downside, they reek of lower class writing, and they are also not very Searchable. Who can remember to search for the number \"73\"? And every time we change the body we have to update the number!\n\n **Exaggerate and appeal to emotion**. There are many words that are charged excessively with emotion, to the point of being upsetting or aggravating.\n - Javascript is cancer\n - Boomer advice you need to unlearn\n\n**Name drop**. It has become popular in PKM blogs and videos lately to hijack the fame of others by mentioning their names in titles, such as [[Niklas Luhmann]], [[Sonke Ahrens]], [Andy Matuschak](notes/Andy%20Matuschak)  and so on. You should keep this to a minimum as doing this tends to stifle your own thinking.\n\n---\n\n## Other people's thoughts\n\nIn putting together this note, I read many others.

Here's a snip:\n\u003e The idea of the bi-directional link goes all the way back to 1945, when [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush) dreamed up the [[Memex]] machine. Vannevar outlined this hypothetical gadget in an essay in _The Atlantic_ called [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/). He wanted a system capable of ‚Äúassociative indexing... whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another... (so that) numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail.‚Äù\n\nZettelkasten.de says [backlinks are bad](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/backlinks-are-bad-links/):\n\u003e Backlinks are bad linking on crack and steroids. Not only do they not provide any link context other than the title, but they are placed automatically. That means that your system (executed by software or habit) provides you with more choice and therefore more cognitive load. On top, you will check the backlinks if provided and that creates opportunity costs. Reviewing the backlinks is time you don‚Äôt spend with other cognitions. You will spend _more_ time with _wasting_ time.\n\nI don't agree, but you might be interested in his article regardless.\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T00:37:36.089014613Z","tags":null},"/notes/Bear-app":{"title":"Bear","content":"A MacOS-only app for [personal knowledge management](notes/PKM).

I dismissed it at the time, thinking it was nothing special, watching Rurouni Kenshin and other shonen series instead. \n\nAs an adult in my 30s, I bought the first three Deluxe Editions, and have read the first two, each in around a day. There's so much happening in every cell, with every character, every interaction, and I seem to find more with every look. Like a lot of other \"dark\" media, Berserk chooses to mock predictable tropes such as the [Hero‚Äôs Journey](notes/Hero's%20Journey) by distorting and disfiguring them. \n\nThe Deluxe Editions are physically enormous and expensive so I will consider carefully whether or not I want to buy them. But I do want to keep reading and see how dark the series goes.\n\n## Other people's thoughts\n\nA fan-made group called Studio Taka made absolutely outstanding motion comics of the first four chapters. They're extremely well voiced and in some ways are better to watch than the anime: [Berserk the Motion Comic](https://youtu.be/I5lLQza7Mew)\n\nStudio Taka also made some amazing [lore videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwyc11QghLo), with a lovely female narrator.\n\nSuper Eyepatch Wolf made a [1 hour 51 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBrUVqZ_pO8). I haven't watched the whole thing. Most notably he points out that a mostly unchanged artwork from [Hieronymus Bosch](notes/Hieronymus%20Bosch) is in the manga, and artist Kentaro Miura says Berserk was strongly influnced by Bosch.","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T00:37:36.089014613Z","tags":null},"/notes/Data_down_action_up":{"title":"Data down, actions up","content":"A rule or convention for making more maintainable component based web applications.

Blogs prefer the philosophy of keeping a post exactly the same after it is published, and if it is changed, a very prominent addendum should be added. Digital gardens don't bother.\n- Organised with Links. A digital garden rarely has a chronological view which is the backbone of a blog. Instead, a digital garden favours Links from one post to another as a way to get around.\n- Digital gardens almost never have ads or sponsorships.\n\nThe term digital garden refers to the real world metaphor of gardening. Notes tend to begin as rough scrappy notes that need to be delicately tended to, like Seedlings. If you do not quickly refine your note into something more useful, you forget what it means and it dies, just like a seedling üå±. As you tend to a note by writing in it, you form threads of thought, like branches, forming a tree üå≥. A robust tree, when re-read, can lead to you thinking of new ideas, or fruit üçé. From these fruit you plant new seedlings, and the cycle continues.\n\n[[Anne-Laure Le Cunff]] wrote a better explanation [here](https://www.mentalnodes.com/a-gardening-guide-for-your-mind).\n\nFor more, I might suggest [my favourite blogs and digital gardens](My%20favourite%20blogs)\n\n[Maggie Appleton](notes/Maggie%20Appleton) wrote a phenomenal essay on the topic: [A Brief History \u0026 Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T00:37:36.089014613Z","tags":null},"/notes/Elden-Ring":{"title":"Elden Ring","content":"\n![](notes/images/EldenRing_Limgrave.jpg)\n\nPossibly my favourite [videogame](notes/videogame) of 2022. Also the first [[Souls-like]] game I ever played. \n\n## Fun things in the game\n\nBy far my favourite part of this game is being able to talk about it with friends and colleagues of whom many are playing it.\n\nSecond of all are the game's incredible visuals, which are often so beautiful it is worthwhile to simply explore. The elaborate and immense scale of the creatures and structures take much inspiration from [Berserk](notes/Berserk), which in turn is a hauntingly beautiful series with a [Bosch](notes/Hieronymus%20Bosch)-ian art style. The game's art style is well captured in this dialog:\n\n\u003e I remember when I was drawing the Undead Dragon, I submitted a design draft that depicted a dragon swarming with maggots and other gross things. Miyazaki handed it back to me saying \"This isn't dignified. Don't rely on the gross factor to portray an undead dragon. Can't you instead try to convey the deep sorrow of a magnificent beast doomed to a slow and possibly endless descent into ruin?\"\n\u003e ‚ÄîMasanori Waragai\n\nFor more, this article is quite fantastic: [The Boschian Horror of ‚ÄòElden Ring‚Äô](https://artreview.com/the-boschian-horror-of-elden-ring/)\n\nThe best [[Open world]] in a videogame in many years. The last few years of open world games have been full of excessive handholding and on screen guides that throttle the player's desire to explore. Elden Ring has almost no guides and both forces and encourages the player to explore. I haven't felt quite so adventurous since I played Morrowind. Writing on games made a 10 minute video talking more: [Why Exploring in Elden Ring Feels So Good](https://youtu.be/qJy8j64pTV4) \n\n## Not so fun things\n\nSo far, I don't care much for the game's story or its characters. I had extremely high expectations of the story, and could not tell you anything about it despite having 30 hours in the game.\n\nThe game balance is terrible. Enemy damage is too high, rune rewards often don't make sense. Videogamedunkey made a [video](https://youtu.be/D1H4o4FW-wA) about it.\n\nEnemy attack animations and range can be so fast and unfair it forces one style of play: defensive counterattacks. Quik Reviews made a [16 minute video](https://youtu.be/YPh0u7WaW64) - and goes on to say [Sekiro](https://www.sekirothegame.com/) has better designed bosses. This person made a [12 minute video](https://youtu.be/R9Vbsr3Ko7M) showing how unfair Malenia is.\n\nI'm playing it on PC, and am aware it runs better on Playstation 5 and looks better on a big TV.

More in his [24 minute video](https://youtu.be/GwBc0ixfbzI)\n\n#### Co-op\n\nElden Ring has a built in coop mode that I do not enjoy. It requires the host to and joining player to both assemble ingredients to cast a spell to join each other. This is fine, but the game also allows Enemy players to join your multiplayer session and kill you. This cannot be turned off. I wanted to enjoy Elden Ring together with a friend at the start of the game, and we were quickly slaughtered by a level 70 player. In addition, I'm told that co-op terminates when the area's boss has been defeated, requiring both players to cast the spell again.\n\nFor those playing on PC, a more traditional co-op multiplayer mode is possible with the [Seamless coop mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510). Note that it requires a new game, and does not trigger Steam achievements. Here's a video of it working!\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QeDUcf1G7YM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n#### Game Engine\n\nThis very smart person deconstructed how Elden Ring's graphics works, and in doing so also also dove deep into DirectX12: [Behind the Pretty Frames: Elden Ring](http://www.mamoniem.com/behind-the-pretty-frames-elden-ring/)\n\n## Tips for winning\n\nParrying is easier with the *buckler*  than any other shield, because it has the *Buckler Parry*.

There‚Äôs an answer for each of these problems but implementing a full solution requires scouring through the Go docs and Hugo‚Äôs own forums for a complete and pragmatic solution.\n\u003e ‚Äî[A throwaway account](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30528827)\n\n\u003e But much like Handlebars, Go template expressions aren‚Äôt REPL friendly, and a the learning experience involves a lot of refreshing and debug output just to get a clue as to how things work.\n\u003e ‚Äî[A throwaway account](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30528827)\n\n\u003e The whole \"They Are Just Go Templates\" is a pretty pathetic cop out. Sorry, but it's true. If I'm trying to use Hugo, I don't want to be digging in Go docs at the same time, and as you point out, you can't know things like scopes and what Go variables might actually be available...I subsequently gave up on Hugo entirely and ported my Hugo sites to Next.js, which is in fact documented--and can work well with TypeScript, so complex pages are fully strongly typed, which makes work in an IDE a breeze. \n\u003e ‚Äî[SomeCallMeTim](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30533110)","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T00:37:36.089014613Z","tags":null},"/notes/Maggie-Appleton":{"title":"Maggie Appleton","content":"\nhttps://maggieappleton.com/\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T00:37:36.089014613Z","tags":null},"/notes/My-favourite-blogs":{"title":"My favourite blogs and digital gardens","content":"\nMy personal notes are heavily inspired by the personal notes, blogs, and [digital gardens](notes/digital%20garden.md) of many others. \n\n## The ones I love the most\n\n- [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) by [[Andy Matuschak]]  is extremely enjoyable to read. He writes short notes that are easy to digest, presenting them with the  [[Sliding panes]] UI pattern for you to keep track of where you came from.\n- [Essays](https://www.gwern.net/index) by [[Gwern Branwen]] is a marvelous and unique part of the internet. Spectacularly well researched posts, that have taught me a lot about how impactful and different a well written blog post is than an atomic note, and many other things. Almost frustratingly, Gwern is almost never wrong about anything.\n - [The Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) by [Maggie Appleton](notes/Maggie%20Appleton) is **beautiful** and *insightful*. Maggie herself is a UI designer and illustrator whose work you have likely seen before, and thus her site features gorgeous [typography](notes/typography) and charming illustrations throughout.\n - [Wonderful things](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/) by Scott Hanselman I have read for many years. He posts less frequently these days, but his content stays relevant for a long time. There are a small amount of ads and sponsorships throughout but they are easy to ignore.\n - [Project Nayuki](https://www.nayuki.io/) by Nayuki is a blog that started in 2007 and is still updated with wonderfully insightful essays, mostly about computer science. The article I re-read most often is about [Tags not hierarchies](https://www.nayuki.io/page/designing-better-file-organization-around-tags-not-hierarchies), but you might want to start with why they [don't like dividends](https://www.nayuki.io/page/i-dislike-dividends).\n\n## Other people's notes I enjoyed browsing \n\n[[Anne-Laure Le Cunff]]'s [Mental Nodes](https://www.mentalnodes.com/about)  has an especially nice note about how [creating makes you live longer](https://www.mentalnodes.com/living-beyond-your-expiration-date).\n\n[LYT kit](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/%2B+Start+Here) by Nick Milo is  a directed set of notes to teach a person how to make a [personal knowledge management](notes/PKM) system that scales well into the future. It is especially thoughtful to people with ADHD and overactive organisation habits.\n\n[Public musings](https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/) by Soren Bjornstad has an interesting note about why  [freedom requires rules](https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#NoRulesNoFreedom).\n\n[Petrichor](https://publish.obsidian.md/bryan-jenks/INDEX) by [[Bryan Jenks]] has some especially interesting notes about [ADHD](https://publish.obsidian.md/bryan-jenks/Z/ADHD).\n\n[Brad Wood's Digital garden](https://garden.bradwoods.io/) is extremely charming, with an aesthetic that reminds me of old brown paper computer manuals. [[Brad Woods]]  is himself seems to be an excellent UI software engineer. Anyone with an interest in JavaScript and UI should look through his notes.\n\n[Everything I know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) by Nikita is **enormous** while remaining quite charming. Lots of emojis and links and pages. I recommend that you simply go there and explore, but if I had to pick one note it would be his note about [relationships](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/relationships/).\n\n[Alexis Rondeau's digital garden](https://publish.obsidian.md/alexisrondeau/) is made with Obsidian Publish and is rich in notes. He has an interesting note exploring whether [increased light improves mood](https://publish.obsidian.md/alexisrondeau/%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F+Happier+Through+Bright+Light+(Experiment)).\n\n[[Joel Hooks]]' [Digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/)\n\n[Moby Diction](https://www.mobydiction.ca/notes) by [[David Drysdale]] has a lot of interesting notes, particularly about story writing and [personal knowledge management](notes/PKM). You might like this one, about how [old ideas generate new ideas](https://www.mobydiction.ca/notes/Knowledge%20work%20means%20transforming%20old%20ideas%20into%20new%20ones/).\n\n[[Thompson Morrison]] and his [FedWiki](https://thompson.wiki.innovateoregon.org/view/welcome-visitors)\n\nhttps://publish.obsidian.md/christopher/%2BWelcome+to+my+note-in-use\n\nSanti https://notes.santiyounger.com/ and https://publish.obsidian.md/santi/welcome\n\nhttps://grimoire.garden/notes/now/, made from Obsidian and [[EleventyJS]] \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PKMS/comments/nrec6j/my_custom_note_site_created_using_eleventyjs_and/\n\nhttps://philosopher.life/#Root:Root%20%5B%5BLegal%20Notice%5D%5D\n\nMade with Obsidian?\nhttp://gordonbrander.com/pattern/creatives-are-measured-by-what-they-create/\n\n\n[[Eleanor Konik]] https://publish.obsidian.md/eleanorkonik/00+Meta/03+Structure/Welcome\n\n[[Bianca Aguilar]]'s [digital garden](https://garden.bianca.digital/) made with Jekyll and Netlify","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T00:37:36.089014613Z","tags":null},"/notes/PKM":{"title":"Personal Knowledge Management","content":"\nWe live in an age of Knowledge work rather than physical labour.

No one can find their information again if everything is called *Untitled*. I have some [advice for writing better note titles](notes/Advice%20for%20writing%20better%20note%20titles).\n- **Note aliases**.

Typing `\u003e [!quote]` won't make a fancy callout. You'll have to use a regular blockquote and add a symbol yourself. \n\n## Drawbacks\n- Significant technical knowledge needed. I had to install [[Golang]], Hugo, Make, add those to my environment path, just to build the website locally. For the tech savvy it doesn't feel like much, but this is too difficult for many people. \n- No RSS. This isn't too big a deal as I don't have any readers now, but providing an RSS feed is a way to protest the overwhelming strength and evil of social media and corporate-funded news. \n\n[^1]: This is a footnote!
