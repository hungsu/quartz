I refer back to my own [advice](/tags/advice) at times.\n\n2022-July-06: This version of my notes is live, using [Quartz](notes/Quartz%20by%20Jacky)!

One should be able to find a note again by searching for it's Title, rather than its contents.\n- Accuracy and Honesty. A title that doesn't reflect it's content is a form of dishonesty, and is why clickbait is so hated. [[Titles are a promise of good content]].\n- Clarity. We should be able to parse a title easily and quickly to determine if it is the note we want. Milliseconds matter.  [[Concise writing takes longer to write, but is worth it]].\n\nIt's worth being aware that the goals and process for writing titles for Notes have very little resemblance to writing [[Headline]]s for Stories, Titles for Blog Posts, or Subject Lines for Emails. It in some ways resembles writing titles for [[Essay]]s.\n\n## Guidelines (not rules)\n\n**Write the document**. Titles tend to emerge from the document as it is written. You may realise on writing the body, you cannot deliver on the promise of your original title. Changing the title then becomes obvious. You may also realise on writing the title, that no single title can encapsulate all you have written. This is a good indicator that your note should be broken apart into atomic notes.\n\n**Write in assertive positive form**. ‚ÄúX causes Y‚Äù is usually better than ‚ÄúX fails to do Z‚Äù. For example:\n\n- Bad: *Doom scrolling doesn't make you smarter*\n- Good: *Doom scrolling makes you stupid*\n\nIn writing this way you may also learn to be more assertive and sure of yourself.\n\n**Phrase unproven notes as questions**. Despite my previous advice to be assertive, if you cannot prove something beyond your own doubts, you should phrase it as a question.\n\n- Bad: *Privilege is inherited*\n- Good: *How much ability is heritable?*\n\n\u003e ‚ö† Be wary of question marks in filenames. You may have to omit them.\n\n**Use consistent and correct spelling**. I have been tempted many times to ignore spelling errors, but this will bite you in future when you attempt to use the search feature in your notes. Take the time to use a spellchecker and fix errors. For the same reason, you should use only a single region's spelling. Don't mix American and Australian English.\n\n**Consider characters you can't type**. I am unable to easily type  *‚ÄúGon√ßalo‚Äù*. So my note for such a person has an alias *‚ÄúGoncalo‚Äù*.\n\n**Look at similar notes**. One way to find them is in a [[Taxonomy of note types]]. You may notice interesting and useful conventions, such as *How To* guides beginning with the words *‚ÄúHow to‚Äì‚Äù*.\n\n## Anti guidelines\n\nThese are guidelines I've seen recommended by others, which I believe you should approach with great caution.\n\n**Move important words earlier**. What is important in one circumstance may not be in another. Consider these two sentences:\n- Front end codebases should not use Typescript\n- Typescript should not be in front end codebases\n\n*Front end codebases* is more important in the first, and *Typescript* is more important in the second. Sometimes it may be worth fussing over moving words earlier, but you can waste a great deal of time without making meaningful progress.\n\n**Arbitrary title length limits**, such as \"Keep titles under 10 words\". have been a waste of time in my experience. Yes, it can be argued there is great satisfaction in reducing a title down to a catch-phrase or concept-handle like length. Where we waste time is the number - hours can be lost musing whether the number is 10 or 12, or if a very complex title can be honed down sufficiently.\n\n**Use Numbers**. Some believe that numbers in titles makes them more interesting and assertive. I believe them to be clickbait-y and low class. Consider these examples:\n\n- 73 thoughts I had while watching Game of Thrones\n- 11 ways to build muscle and lose fat\n- Read faster in just 5 steps\n\nThey have some advantages, namely that they give you some idea of how large the note is. On the downside, they reek of lower class writing, and they are also not very Searchable. Who can remember to search for the number \"73\"? And every time we change the body we have to update the number!\n\n **Exaggerate and appeal to emotion**. There are many words that are charged excessively with emotion, to the point of being upsetting or aggravating.\n - Javascript is cancer\n - Boomer advice you need to unlearn\n\n**Name drop**. It has become popular in PKM blogs and videos lately to hijack the fame of others by mentioning their names in titles, such as [[Niklas Luhmann]], [[Sonke Ahrens]], [Andy Matuschak](notes/Andy%20Matuschak)  and so on. You should keep this to a minimum as doing this tends to stifle your own thinking.\n\n---\n\n## Other people's thoughts\n\nIn putting together this note, I read many others.

Also the first [[Souls-like]] game I ever played. \n\n## Fun things in the game\n\nBy far my favourite part of this game is being able to talk about it with friends and colleagues of whom many are playing it.\n\nSecond of all are the game's incredible visuals, which are often so beautiful it is worthwhile to simply explore. The elaborate and immense scale of the creatures and structures take much inspiration from [[Berserk]], which in turn is a hauntingly beautiful series with a [Bosch](notes/Hieronymus%20%Bosch)-ian art style. The game's art style is well captured in this dialog:\n\n\u003e I remember when I was drawing the Undead Dragon, I submitted a design draft that depicted a dragon swarming with maggots and other gross things. Miyazaki handed it back to me saying \"This isn't dignified. Don't rely on the gross factor to portray an undead dragon. Can't you instead try to convey the deep sorrow of a magnificent beast doomed to a slow and possibly endless descent into ruin?\"\n\u003e ‚ÄîMasanori Waragai\n\nFor more, this article is quite fantastic: [The Boschian Horror of ‚ÄòElden Ring‚Äô](https://artreview.com/the-boschian-horror-of-elden-ring/)\n\nThe best [[Open world]] in a videogame in many years. The last few years of open world games have been full of excessive handholding and on screen guides that throttle the player's desire to explore. Elden Ring has almost no guides and both forces and encourages the player to explore. I haven't felt quite so adventurous since I played Morrowind. Writing on games made a 10 minute video talking more: [Why Exploring in Elden Ring Feels So Good](https://youtu.be/qJy8j64pTV4) \n\n## Not so fun things\n\nSo far, I don't care much for the game's story or its characters. I had extremely high expectations of the story, and could not tell you anything about it despite having 30 hours in the game.\n\nThe game balance is terrible. Enemy damage is too high, rune rewards often don't make sense. Videogamedunkey made a [video](https://youtu.be/D1H4o4FW-wA) about it.\n\nEnemy attack animations and range can be so fast and unfair it forces one style of play: defensive counterattacks. Quik Reviews made a [16 minute video](https://youtu.be/YPh0u7WaW64) - and goes on to say [Sekiro](https://www.sekirothegame.com/) has better designed bosses. This person made a [12 minute video](https://youtu.be/R9Vbsr3Ko7M) showing how unfair Malenia is.\n\nI'm playing it on PC, and am aware it runs better on Playstation 5 and looks better on a big TV. PC gamers should note the game is capped at 60FPS.\n\n## Fun things outside the game\n\n### Stuff I personally enjoyed\n\n[[Carbot Animations]] did some hilarious [spoofs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSyRf8rAjTs)\n\nBlaidd voice actor Scott Arthur reads thirst tweets in a [4 minute video](https://youtu.be/PE6wLtf7Y_0)\n\n### Stuff I haven't tried or understand\n\n#### Glitches\n\n[[Spiffing Brit]] found that immortality is possible by dying on purpose to first boss in a [24 minute video](https://youtu.be/GwBc0ixfbzI)\n\n#### Co-op\n\nElden Ring has a built in coop mode that I do not enjoy. It requires the host to and joining player to both assemble ingredients to cast a spell to join each other. This is fine, but the game also allows Enemy players to join your multiplayer session and kill you. This cannot be turned off. I wanted to enjoy Elden Ring together with a friend at the start of the game, and we were quickly slaughtered by a level 70 player. In addition, I'm told that co-op terminates when the area's boss has been defeated, requiring both players to cast the spell again.\n\nFor those playing on PC, a more traditional co-op multiplayer mode is possible with the [Seamless coop mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510). Note that it requires a new game, and does not trigger Steam achievements. Here's a video of it working!\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QeDUcf1G7YM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n#### Game Engine\n\nThis very smart person deconstructed how Elden Ring's graphics works, and in doing so also also dove deep into DirectX12: [Behind the Pretty Frames: Elden Ring](http://www.mamoniem.com/behind-the-pretty-frames-elden-ring/)\n\n## Tips for winning\n\nParrying is easier with the *buckler*  than any other shield, because it has the *Buckler Parry*. It has more frames and a shorter start.\n![](https://preview.redd.it/qsnofkl6vzk81.png?width=1644\u0026format=png\u0026auto=webp\u0026s=d2fb2ba3255b51ae16ab781268db4d6de4130ff4)\n\n[Reddit: I tested parrying frame data, here's everything I know](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/t54kyj/technical_guide_help_i_tested_parrying_frame_data/)\n\nStagger, and Critical hit. Stagger your enemies by inflicting Poise damage which causes a glowing golden body part to appear. Critical hit by walking up to the that golden body part and pressing R1.\n\nJumping causes the lower half of your body to become invincible for 25 out of 30 frames. Since it's just the lower half, overhead attacks still hurt you. Zullie the witch explains in this [video](https://youtu.be/8zdbqTHtnr4). Equipment weight also has no effect on jumping, unlike dodging. \n\nJump attacks also inflict 15-29 poise damage, according to this [Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/tx004b/comment/i3ik298/?utm_source=reddit\u0026utm_medium=web2x\u0026context=3)\n\nCharged power attacks do 40 poise damage","lastmodified":"2022-07-07T21:12:57.666220912Z","tags":null},"/notes/Hieronymus-Bosch":{"title":"Hieronymus Bosch","content":"\nHigh resolution scans: [Bosch project](http://boschproject.org/#/artworks/)\n\nGreat Art Explained did a [50 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBG621XEegk)","lastmodified":"2022-07-07T21:12:57.666220912Z","tags":null},"/notes/Maggie-Appleton":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-07-07T21:12:57.666220912Z","tags":null},"/notes/PKM":{"title":"Personal Knowledge Management","content":"\nWe live in an age of Knowledge work rather than physical labour.
