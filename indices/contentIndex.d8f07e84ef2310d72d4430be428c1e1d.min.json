I bought this to replace my ageing R9 285, a GPU released in 2014 on a 28nm process.\n\nI paid $455.78USD for it including shipping and taxes. A little higher than I wanted, but still much better than the cryptocurrency inflated prices of a short while ago. Mine is the Powercolor Fighter version, which is a little smaller than other cards with the same chip.\n\nThis GPU is massively underrated. It experienced horrifically bad press at launch, with its competition beating it handily in real and synthetic benchmarks at the time, and to this day everyone seems to want nVidia's RTX 3000 series cards. Times have now changed, and I think more people should snap this up instead.\n\n## Shortcomings\n\n*No DLSS.* AI upsampling is the amazing technique of increasing the size of an image while adding in missing detail. This is a huge talking point for videogames in 2021 and 2022, particularly as gamers (including myself) want high FPS at 4K resolution which is extremely difficult to achieve...unless you have AI upsampling through DLSS. The 6700 XT cannot do nVidia's DLSS, thus I'm limited to simpler algorithmic upsampling rather than AI upsampling.\n\nThat's all, there's no other shortcomings I've found so far. On to the fun stuff!\n\n## Why it's awesome\n*The 3rd most powerful GPU in the world per-watt*. Drawing just 215 watts, it delivered 112FPS average across a suite of 9 games. Compare this to the much more popular RTX 3080, which requires 333 watts but only delivered 142FPS average across the same games.[^1] Is 25% more FPS worth 54% more wattage? For those of us with computer cases that are not the size of furniture, I think not!\n\n*Compact*. With the RTX 3000 series of cards from nvidia, gamers across the world seem to have accepted GPUs that are longer, taller, fatter, and heavier. They've accepted larger cases, more intimidating cooling solutions and clever installation gadgets to support all the weight and torsion force. The 6700 XT in comparison is extremely svelte and requires no such trickery.\n\n![Quake 2 RTX](notes/images/Quake2RTX.jpg)\n\n*Ray tracing!* This is my first GPU with ray tracing, which looks incredible in the games that have it, like [[CP2077]] and [Quake II RTX](https://www.gog.com/game/quake_ii_rtx) . Light bounces off of multiple surfaces in realistic ways, and casts more realistic shadows and reflections.\n\n*Quiet*. At the aforementioned 215 watt power draw, the GPU often runs so cool the fans do not even spin.\n\nIf you got this far, you might be interested in the rest of my [computer](notes/computer), or the [videogame](notes/videogame)s I've been playing.\n\n[^1]: [Graphics Card Power Consumption and Efficiency Tested](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/graphics-card-power-consumption-tested) Scroll to \"Analyzing GPU Power Use and Efficiency\" ","lastmodified":"2022-08-31T19:02:18.376965918Z","tags":null},"/notes/Advice-for-writing-better-note-titles":{"title":"Advice for writing better note titles","content":"\nGiven a page within a [PKM](notes/PKM) system, how do we write a good and useful title for it?\n\nQualities we want:\n\n- Searchability. One should be able to find a note again by searching for it's Title, rather than its contents.\n- Accuracy and Honesty. A title that doesn't reflect it's content is a form of dishonesty, and is why clickbait is so hated. [[Titles are a promise of good content]].\n- Clarity. We should be able to parse a title easily and quickly to determine if it is the note we want. Milliseconds matter.  [[Concise writing takes longer to write, but is worth it]].\n\nIt's worth being aware that the goals and process for writing titles for Notes have very little resemblance to writing [[Headline]]s for Stories, Titles for Blog Posts, or Subject Lines for Emails. It in some ways resembles writing titles for [[Essay]]s.\n\n## Guidelines (not rules)\n\n**Write in assertive positive form**. ‚ÄúX causes Y‚Äù is usually better than ‚ÄúX fails to do Z‚Äù. For example:\n\n- Bad: *Doom scrolling doesn't make you smarter*\n- Good: *Doom scrolling makes you stupid*\n\nIn writing this way you may also learn to be more assertive and sure of yourself.\n\n**Phrase unproven notes as questions**. Despite my previous advice to be assertive, if you cannot prove something beyond your own doubts, you should phrase it as a question.\n\n- Bad: *Privilege is inherited*\n- Good: *How much ability is heritable?*\n\n\u003e [!WARNING] Attention Windows users\n\u003e \n\u003e If you are on Windows, you cannot have question marks in filenames. You'll have to infer that a file is a question, and perhaps rely on `title:` attributes if you are using Obsidian or Logseq.\n\n**Use consistent and correct spelling**. I have been tempted many times to ignore spelling errors, but this will bite you in future when you attempt to use the search feature in your notes. Take the time to use a spellchecker and fix errors. For the same reason, you should use only a single region's spelling. Don't mix American and Australian English.\n\n**Link to the note**. By considering how another note is related to the current note, this puts you in a mindset to consider a usable title. For example, \n\n- There was an existing document, `Run VM using Vagrant`. But, I couldn't use this document as it was written for users running x86 Macs and I had an M1 Mac. In response, I wrote a document `Run Windows VM on M1 Mac using Parallels`, then added a link to my document in the original.\n- I had a note with reasons for using apps like Obsidian, called \"Reasons to use a linked note system\". This was precise, but felt weak and uninspiring to use whenever I tried to link it. Changing it to an imperative, \"[You should link your notes](notes/You%20should%20link%20your%20notes)\" made it much more fun to put in other documents.\n\n**Write the document**. Titles tend to emerge from the document as it is written. You may realise on writing the body, you cannot deliver on the promise of your original title. Changing the title then becomes obvious. You may also realise on writing the title, that no single title can encapsulate all you have written. This is a good indicator that your note should be broken apart into atomic notes.\n\n**Consider characters you can't type**. I am unable to easily type  *‚ÄúGon√ßalo‚Äù*. So my note for such a person has an alias *‚ÄúGoncalo‚Äù*.\n\n**Look at similar notes**. One way to find them is in a [[Taxonomy of note types]]. You may notice interesting and useful conventions, such as *How To* guides beginning with the words *‚ÄúHow to‚Äì‚Äù*.\n\n## Anti guidelines\n\nThese are guidelines I've seen recommended by others, which I believe you should approach with great caution.\n\n**Move important words earlier**. What is important in one circumstance may not be in another. Consider these two sentences:\n- Front end codebases should not use Typescript\n- Typescript should not be in front end codebases\n\n*Front end codebases* is more important in the first, and *Typescript* is more important in the second. Sometimes it may be worth fussing over moving words earlier, but you can waste a great deal of time without making meaningful progress.\n\n**Arbitrary title length limits**, such as \"Keep titles under 10 words\". have been a waste of time in my experience. Yes, it can be argued there is great satisfaction in reducing a title down to a catch-phrase or concept-handle like length. Where we waste time is the number - hours can be lost musing whether the number is 10 or 12, or if a very complex title can be honed down sufficiently.\n\n**Use Numbers**. Some believe that numbers in titles makes them more interesting and assertive. I believe them to be clickbait-y and low class. Consider these examples:\n\n- 73 thoughts I had while watching Game of Thrones\n- 11 ways to build muscle and lose fat\n- Read faster in just 5 steps\n\nThey have some advantages, namely that they give you some idea of how large the note is. On the downside, they reek of lower class writing, and they are also not very Searchable. Who can remember to search for the number \"73\"? And every time we change the body we have to update the number!\n\n **Exaggerate and appeal to emotion**. There are many words that are charged excessively with emotion, to the point of being upsetting or aggravating.\n - Javascript is cancer\n - Boomer advice you need to unlearn\n\n**Name drop**. It has become popular in PKM blogs and videos lately to hijack the fame of others by mentioning their names in titles, such as [[Niklas Luhmann]], [[Sonke Ahrens]], [Andy Matuschak](notes/Andy%20Matuschak)  and so on. You should keep this to a minimum as doing this tends to stifle your own thinking.\n\n---\n\n## Other people's thoughts\n\nIn putting together this note, I read many others.

Here's a snip:\n\u003e The idea of the bi-directional link goes all the way back to 1945, when [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush) dreamed up the [[Memex]] machine. Vannevar outlined this hypothetical gadget in an essay in _The Atlantic_ called [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/). He wanted a system capable of ‚Äúassociative indexing... whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another... (so that) numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail.‚Äù\n\nZettelkasten.de says [backlinks are bad](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/backlinks-are-bad-links/):\n\u003e Backlinks are bad linking on crack and steroids. Not only do they not provide any link context other than the title, but they are placed automatically. That means that your system (executed by software or habit) provides you with more choice and therefore more cognitive load. On top, you will check the backlinks if provided and that creates opportunity costs. Reviewing the backlinks is time you don‚Äôt spend with other cognitions. You will spend _more_ time with _wasting_ time.\n\nI don't agree, but you might be interested in his article regardless.\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-31T19:02:18.376965918Z","tags":null},"/notes/Backlinks-should-include-context":{"title":"Backlinks should include context","content":"\n[Backlinks](notes/Backlink.md) are becoming increasingly popular in note taking applications, such as [[Obsidian]] and [[Notion]].

But we do not know why. Does Caitlin Floyd direct horror movies? Is Justice Fears a Horror Movie critic? Who knows!\n\n![](notes/images/notion-backlink.jpg)\n\nThe equivalent Backlink in Obsidian includes some context, like this:\n\n![obsidian backlink](notes/images/obsidian-backlink.jpg)\n\nBy supplying some context around the Backlink, we know why the link was made, and it becomes far more interesting and useful.

All notes are permanently a work in progress. Blogs prefer the philosophy of keeping a post exactly the same after it is published, and if it is changed, a very prominent addendum should be added. Digital gardens don't bother with this limitation, and relish making changes at the whim of the author. A signature of digital gardens of the 90s was [Under Construction GIFs](http://textfiles.com/underconstruction/).\n- **Link first organisation**. Blogs almost always to have a chronological timeline view, with recent posts at the top. A digital garden often has no such timeline, favouring Links from one post to another as a way to get around. Some even have [backlinks](notes/Backlink.md).\n- **No ads or upsells**. Blogs frequently have ads, or are written so the author can sell you another product. Digital gardens almost never have ads or sponsorships, and never bother with SEO. \n\n## Etymology of the Analogy\n\nDigital gardens were greatly motivated by the observation that simple handwritten notes tend to *rot*. Some time after they are written, the author may lose them entirely, or forget what the note means.\n\nBy contrast, a digital gardener prevents notes from rotting by treating their notes like a living thing. \n- Notes tend to begin as rough scrappy notes that need to be delicately tended to, like Seedlings. If you do not quickly refine your note into something more useful, you forget what it means and it dies, just like a seedling üå±.\n- As you tend to a note by writing in it, you form threads of thought, like branches, forming a tree üå≥.\n- A robust tree, when re-read, can lead to you thinking of new ideas, or fruit üçé. From these fruit you plant new seedlings, and the cycle continues.\n\nThe earliest occurrence of the term \"garden\" for online notes may be this 1998 essay, [Hypertext Gardens](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html).\n\n[Maggie Appleton](notes/Maggie%20Appleton) wrote and illustrated a much better analogy of digital gardens here: [Growing the Evergreens](https://maggieappleton.com/evergreens)\n\n## More reading\n\nMy digital garden is made using Obsidian and [Quartz](notes/Quartz%20by%20Jacky).

The visuals of the world and its people are all tied together with some incredible lore and worldbuilding, aided by [[George R R Martin]].[^1] This [Gamespot article](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-heres-the-lore-and-history-of-the-lands-between/1100-6502537/) explains it better. If you have the time, the Elden ring lore videos by [Vaatividya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYDs_Inzkz4) are so amazing they were reposted on Elden Ring's official channel.\n\n## Not so fun things\n\nDespite the lore, the game's story or its characters have been entirely forgettable for me. I had extremely high expectations of the story given its involvement with George R. R. Martin, and could not tell you anything about it despite having 40 hours in the game.\n\nThe game balance is terrible. Enemy damage is too high, rune rewards often don't make sense. Videogamedunkey made a [video](https://youtu.be/D1H4o4FW-wA) about it.\n\nEnemy attack animations and range can be so fast and unfair it forces one style of play: defensive counterattacks. Quik Reviews made a [16 minute video](https://youtu.be/YPh0u7WaW64) - and goes on to say [Sekiro](https://www.sekirothegame.com/) has better designed bosses. This person made a [12 minute video](https://youtu.be/R9Vbsr3Ko7M) showing how unfair Malenia is.\n\nI'm playing it on PC, and am aware it runs better on Playstation 5 and looks better on a big TV. PC gamers should note the game is capped at 60FPS.\n\n## Fun things outside the game\n\n### Stuff I personally enjoyed\n\n#### Videos\n\n[[Carbot Animations]] did some hilarious [spoofs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSyRf8rAjTs).\n\nBlaidd voice actor Scott Arthur reads thirst tweets in a [4 minute video](https://youtu.be/PE6wLtf7Y_0)\n\n#### Co-op\n\nElden Ring has a built in coop mode that I do not enjoy. It requires the host to and joining player to both assemble ingredients to cast a spell to join each other. This is fine, but the game also allows Enemy players to join your multiplayer session and kill you. This cannot be turned off. I wanted to enjoy Elden Ring together with a friend at the start of the game, and we were quickly slaughtered by a level 70 player. In addition, I'm told that co-op terminates when the area's boss has been defeated, requiring both players to cast the spell again.\n\nFor a much more fun experience,  those playing on PC can have a more traditional co-op multiplayer mode with the [Seamless coop mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510). Note that it requires starting a new game. Here's a video of it working!\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QeDUcf1G7YM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n### Stuff I haven't tried or understand\n\n#### Merchandise\n\n![](https://c.neevacdn.net/image/fetch/s--FaHOKSN3--/https%3A//top-mmo.fr/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/fmini-the-raging-wolf-05b-1653511628832.jpg?savepath=fmini-the-raging-wolf-05b-1653511628832.jpg)\n\nThere are two [[Figuarts Minis]] for Elden Ring: [Raging Wolf](https://www.tamashiinations.com/product/details.php?detail=831) and [Melina](https://www.tamashiinations.com/product/details.php?detail=832).\n\n![Photo of Soul Arts book](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0117/3399/1490/products/KEEP-271A1325copy.jpg?v=1656584103\u0026width=823)\n\nVaatividya made an art book of all Souls games, including Elden Ring, called [Soul Arts](https://www.tuneandfairweather.com/products/soul-arts-presented-by-vaatividya).

I've wasted a lot of time with builds, namely from Fextralife on the Elden Ring wiki, whose builds seem famous but I did not have fun or success with. In particular, his [Inquisitor build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGvtLj7Y_ws) with the Ghiza's Wheel I really disliked despite it being one of his newest builds, just 9 days old at time of writing. I've since found a player named cRPG Bro who has builds I enjoy a lot more. I have a number of builds I switch between:\n\n- Greatsword and Flame of the Redmanes. Particularly amazing on horseback\n- 2√ó Curved Swords. My preferred weapon most of the time for killing small and fast creatures such as dogs, but does so much damage I can even use this against some bosses.\n- Misericorde and Flame of the Redmanes, mostly following this [cRPG Bro video](https://youtu.be/DxCpnGtO1ns)\n- Shield and Spear, loosely following this [cRPG Bro video](https://youtu.be/3CN852mQY2Q). Based on theory that a Guard Boost of 100 means you lose no stamina when you block with a shield. It achieves this by upgrading a Greatshield, then casting Scholar's Shield with your right hand. Needs 12 intelligence to use the Scholar's Shield spell which increases Guard Boost by 20‚Äì22%.\n- Colossus Greatbow, for those annoying situations where I can't hit something up close. I did try Crossbows, but I dislike that they do so little damage.\n\nSome builds I haven't tried but look promising:\n\ncRPG Bro dual hammer Strength build https://youtu.be/65QCwG8dGVg \n\nVampiric mace build https://youtu.be/VZSNdbyUyHU \n\n### Do lots of Critical hits\n\nEnemies have a Stance health bar, and all attacks do some amount of Stance or Poise damage. Do enough Poise damage and the enemy will buckle over, sometimes revealing a glowing golden body part. Move quickly to that golden body part and press R1 to critical hit. Take care to NOT run - you'll do a running attack instead.\n\n| Weapon and attack           | Poise damage |\n| --------------------------- | ------------ |\n| Misericorde R1              | 4            |\n| Misericorde R2              | 8            |\n| Misericorde charged R2      | 24           |\n| Misericorde jumping R1      | 6            |\n| Misericorde jumping R2      | 16           |\n| Greatsword R1               | 20           |\n| Greatsword R2               | 20           |\n| Greatsword charged R2       | 48           |\n| Greatsword jumping R1       | 20           |\n| Greatsword jumping R2       | 32           |\n| Greatsword stamp upward cut | 44           |\n\nSource: [This is how much Poise Damage EVERY SINGLE Weapon does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-69yJdd70)\n\n### Learn to dodge and jump\n\nJumping causes the lower half of your body to become invincible for 25 out of 30 frames. Since it's just the lower half, overhead attacks still hurt you. Zullie the witch explains in this [video](https://youtu.be/8zdbqTHtnr4). Equipment weight also has no effect on jumping, unlike dodging.\n\n### Learn to parry\n\nParrying causes a special kind of stagger which allows enemies to be *Critical Hit*. This stagger is separate from the Stance Break stagger, meaning you can combine both to inflict many such Critical Hits. A famous Elden Ring player, *ONGBAL*, demonstrates this [here](https://youtu.be/VV0dCv3FdGc).\n\nParrying is easier with the *buckler*  than any other shield, because it has the *Buckler Parry*. It has more frames and a shorter start.\n![](https://preview.redd.it/qsnofkl6vzk81.png?width=1644\u0026format=png\u0026auto=webp\u0026s=d2fb2ba3255b51ae16ab781268db4d6de4130ff4)\n\n[Reddit: I tested parrying frame data, here's everything I know](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/t54kyj/technical_guide_help_i_tested_parrying_frame_data/)\n\nIt's also worth observing how others parry, such as this [video](https://youtu.be/i8T2trUiiZY) of a player defeating a boss without ever getting hit.\n\nI've heard there is a [Golden Parry](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Parry) skill which makes parry even easier. Here's a [video of where to find it](https://youtu.be/DxCpnGtO1ns?t=680), within the Capital outskirts.\n\n### Bosses\n\nThere's so much to talk about, I've moved it all to its own page, [Elden Ring bosses](notes/Elden%20Ring%20bosses).\n\n[^1]: Interview with George https://youtu.be/xHzJG1hHTdU","lastmodified":"2022-08-31T19:02:18.376965918Z","tags":null},"/notes/Elden-Ring-bosses":{"title":"","content":"## Bosses I can't beat\n\n\n\nAncient Dragon Lansseax. The Ashen Hollow did a [video about all the Elden Ring dragons](https://youtu.be/bgW53fwgyo4?t=713), including Lansseax. Only tried once.\n\n## Bosses I had trouble with, then beat\n\nPutrid Avatar in Dragonbarrow ([Wiki](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Putrid+Avatar)). I kept dying to Scarlet Rot. After reading wiki I learned the scarlet rot was dodgeable, and winning was a simple matter of dodging sideways, following with *Flame of the Redmanes* twice to break poise and do critical hits.\n\n![](https://c.neevacdn.net/image/fetch/s--Ftr-RmGv--/https%3A//cdn.statically.io/img/gamertweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/how-to-defeat-starscourge-radahn-in-elden-ring.jpg?savepath=how-to-defeat-starscourge-radahn-in-elden-ring.jpg)\n\n[Starscourge Radahn](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Starscourge+Radahn). This took me an hour or so. I died a lot trying to stun him with *Flame of the Redmanes* which takes 3 casts to stun him, and put me in harms way too much. Winning meant realising I didn't have to do much fighting, and just had to keep resummoning allies, while keeping a dagger handy to do critical hits when his poise was broken. Redoing this battle so much was a blessing in disguise, as it allowed me to stock up on *Radahn's Spears* which are scattered on the battlefield.\n\n[Night's cavalry in Dragonbarrow](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Night's+Cavalry). I know it can be cheesed into falling to its death but I didn't want to do that. Ultimately found that using a shield and spear made it extremely easy. It does single big attacks that can be easily blocked, after which I can do a Guard Counter for big damage. It's horse soon died and I could follow with a critical hit.\n\n[Godskin Noble](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Godskin+Noble) on the bridge to the Divine Tower of Liurnia. This took me maybe an hour to beat. I tried initially with a shield and spear, but kept dying in its final stages where it starts to use a rapid stabbing move. I switched to a Misericorde, and found myself getting trapped by its rolling attack. Finally realised if I stayed at the maximum range of *Flame of the Redmanes*, I could avoid most of its attacks with a slight sidestep or dodge, and could keep it stunned before it initiated its rolling attack.\n\n\n![](https://eip.gg/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/black-blade-kindred-boss-guide-featured-image-elden-ring-1024x575.jpg)\n\nBlack Blade Kindred outside Bestial Sanctum ([Wiki](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Blade+Kindred)). It does SO much damage. I got very close, using Misericorde with Flame of the Redmanes and Latenna the Albinauric. This was frequently problematic as I could break his stance, but he's so large his head would clip into stairs or the wall and I couldn't get a critical hit. I tried briefly with a Greatbow, hoping to stay out of range, but that didn't do well at all. I finally won with *Greatsword* using the *Determination* skill which buffs the next attack, Claw Talisman to buff jumping attacks, and repeatedly using jumping R2 attacks. I had Latenna as backup, though she died very quickly.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/elden-ring/6/65/Altus_TreeSentinels.jpg)\n\n[Twin Tree Sentinels in Leyndell](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tree+Sentinel). This ended up being a simple matter of baiting one out to fight alone, killing it, then killing the other one. So easy I should do it more often.\n\n\n![Bell bearing hunter](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/elden-ring/b/b3/Elden_DragonB_BellHunter.jpg)\n\n[Bell Bearing Hunter](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bell+Bearing+Hunter). Tried many times. He has physical attacks that do massive damage, and takes some more Piercing damage. He can throw a sword that cuts twice which is enough to kill me, often when I'm drinking a potion. My best attempt was by using Torrent to jump onto the roof of the shack and shoot him repeatedly, but I still died. A nearby T-rex dog can still reach me, and this feels cheesy. I made many attempts with a great shield and spear, but I run out of stamina so quickly that his attacks eventually break through. I was able to get him to just over 50% HP with my greatsword and *Flame of the Redmanes*, but it's often raining when I fight. Ideas...\n- Maybe I need a ranged lightning attack, or lightning grease?\n- He has a slow shield bash that leaves him vulnerable, I wonder if I can bait that more often? This guy explains how to bait it https://youtu.be/O_kYg4T8DHU\n- demo of baiting shield bash and poise breaking\n- maybe I can learn to parry?\n\t- This [guide](https://youtu.be/oKgRvJsNfxc) looks great. But the guide's creator also admits he gets beaten a lot by this variant of the boss!\n\t- This player beat him with daggers without taking a single hit! https://youtu.be/zt7hyCE1IoU\n\t- This player beat him with a club without taking any hits. He makes use of a weapon parry and jumping heavy attacks to keep him perpetually staggered.\n- this guy uses a greatshield and hoarfrost stomp https://youtu.be/aSAmcyAe-8s\n\nI finally beat him on 2022-08-26 at level 110, and it was hilariously easy. I just *Flame of the Redmanes* twice to break his poise, and did Critical hits with *Misericorde*. It wasn't raining when I fought, I wonder if that made a difference?\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-31T19:02:18.376965918Z","tags":null},"/notes/Ember-CLI":{"title":"Ember CLI","content":"A [[CLI]] tool for scaffolding [EmberJS](notes/EmberJS) apps.\n\n[Github](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli)\n\nMade by Stefan Penner\n\nWorks on Windows but is slow because of NTFS.

Popularised a [UI engineering](notes/UI%20engineering) technique called [data down, actions up](notes/Data_down_action_up).\n\n\n## Why Ember over other frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte? \n\nThings admittedly look bad for Ember right now. According to [State of JS 2021](https://2021.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/front_end_frameworks_experience_ranking), only 21% of people who used Ember would choose to use it again:\n\n![[StateofJS_2021_satisfaction.png]]\n\nSo why choose Ember?\n\n- CrowdStrike uses it, and they're an astonishingly good place to work. \n\nFor more detail, [[I built the same app in Svelte, Vue, and Ember in 2022]]\n\n## How to start learning Ember\n\nEmberJS was made in a highly opinionated way that favours convention over configuration, and learning these conventions is the most difficult part for UI engineers new to Ember. In particular, [Rock and roll with Ember](https://balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs/) comments that Ember's Routing conventions are the hardest to learn.\n\n\n## How Ember works\n\nLike other frameworks, Ember is made up of many parts. This includes:\n\n- A live reload server\n- [[Handlebars templating]] for HTML components\n- [[Ember CLI]], which is how the server is started and how routes are added to an Ember app\n- [Ember Inspector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ember-inspector/bmdblncegkenkacieihfhpjfppoconhi), a browser extension for Chrome\n- [[QUnit]] for testing\n- [[RouterJS]] and some conventions\n- [[Ember Data]] for state management\n\n## Ember's conventions\n\n\nIntroduces nesting\n```handlebars\n\u003cUiFiles::MyComponent /\u003e\n```\n\n\n\nComponent arguments (props in VueJS)\n```handlebars\n\u003cMyComponent @answer={{42}} /\u003e\n```\n\nCommunity generally dislikes Watching or Observing data\n\n\n### Routing and file hierarchies\n\n### Ember Editions and major versions\n\nEmber has a concept called Ember Editions, where major shifts in philosophy  are marked with a name. These are distinct from [[Semantic Versioning]]. In Ember, a Major version change means APIs were removed.\n \n[[Ember Octane]] is the first named Ember Edition, and began with Ember 3.15\n\nAnyone migrating from Classic to Ember Octane might like the [ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/](https://ember-learn.github.io/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/)\n\nThe next Ember Edition will be named Polaris, and has not yet released as of 2022-07-29, Ember 4.6.\n\n## More Ember\n\nOfficial [website](https://emberjs.com/)\n\n[The Official EmberJS Blog](https://blog.emberjs.com/) Includes posts from The Ember Times, as well as major releases of EmberJS.\n\n[[Honeypot]] made a [25 minute documentary about Ember](https://youtu.be/Cvz-9ccflKQ)\n\n[^1]: [State of JS 2021 Libraries changes over time](https://2021.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/tools_arrows)","lastmodified":"2022-08-31T19:02:18.376965918Z","tags":null},"/notes/Every-productivity-system-stops-working-eventually":{"title":"Every productivity system stops working eventually","content":"\nOne of the most important things to know about [productivity routines](notes/productivity%20routine) and systems is that none are invincible.

She is tired and unarmed. There is no escape. To date, every single person who has heard this whistle has died. One dilophosaurus sniffs his helpless meal.\n\nChris Pratt appears and kills it.

The dinosaurs appear so frequently and the characters always escape, giving us no reason at all to fear them.\n\nThere are many other things to say about this movie, but I'll leave it there.

As of 2021-January-01, I've decided to retire it, though I did enjoy the experiment.\n\n## Things I liked and will miss\n\n1. Linux window management is excellent, marvelous even. By combining GNOME with [PaperWM](https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM), I've no need for multiple monitors at all. MacOS and Windows application management that floats and overlaps windows by default feels prehistoric and wrong. I miss this so much that I will be looking into writing something similar for Windows.\n2. It runs entirely off a USB drive! Windows absolutely refused to be installed on a USB drive.\n3. No forced updates. Windows is notorious for forcing updates even during user activity. Under Linux I can rest well knowing that updates are fully under my control.\n4. I like the lack of bloatware. I really don't appreciate the default installation of Cortana, Candy Crush and many other rubbish apps in Windows.\n5. Far fewer notifications. Windows seems to come with a lot of nonsense notifications, such as\n   - use Microsoft Edge\n   - use Onedrive\n   - do a virus scan\n6. Some of my development work is faster. Namely, builds and fetches.\n\n## Things that gave me trouble, but are not deal breakers\n\n1. Audio didn't work quite right out of the box. I have a Dual Shock 4 controller with a 3.5mm headphone jack I often use, and Linux wouldn't use it at first. Once I installed PulseAudio Volume Control I was able to set output to what I wanted, but this introduced another problem of noticeable audio delay in games, which took another config tweak. Windows audio device management is much easier and had none of these issues.\n2. Gamepad setup was fussy. I had some trouble using my Dualshock 4 in games. Some Googling and shell commands got things working, but this wasn't necessary in Windows. Many others have reported that this works out of the box for them, so I seem to be an outlier. But this was my experience nonetheless.\n3. Installing apps. In Windows I knew the default location to be `Program Files` on the drive with Windows on it, C:. In MacOS, I knew this to be in `Applications`. For Linux, apparently, the [best practice](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1148/when-installing-user-applications-where-do-best-practices-suggest-they-be-loc) is the `/opt` folder\n4. In Windows I use F13 and F14 keys for Push-To-Talk and Toggle Voice Activation. In Linux, these are registered as UNK191 and UNK192. UNK191 also seems to be called the \"Tools\" key.\n5. Screenshot tools. After some fiddling I realised Ubuntu's native GNOME screenshot tool can be bound to my desired shortcut, `Alt`+`Shift`+`$`.\n6. App formats, app stores and app repositories. I still do not know the difference between a snap, an app image or flat pak.\n\n\n## Things that forced me back to Windows\n\n1. Some Windows apps and games either don't have a Linux substitute, or don't run in Linux. So far I have tried and failed to run these or find substitutes:\n   - AirExplorer\n   - Adobe suite, though people have had success running them in [WinApps](https://github.com/Fmstrat/winapps)\n   - Many many games, including but not limited to\n     - Destiny 2, which works with Geforce NOW but has too much latency\n     - EA Games, such as Star Wars Fallen Order\n     - Epic Games exclusives, such as Fortnite and the Pathless\n     - [Vermintide 2](https://www.protondb.com/app/552500)\n     - The Witcher 3, which I can still play with Geforce NOW, with lag. See my experience with [[game-streaming]]\n   - Popular benchmarking software, including\n     - Cinebench\n     - Crystaldiskmark\n     - Userbenchmark\n   - The NVDA screen reader, and Internet Explorer\n   - Virtual Reality. My headset is Windows Mixed Reality which makes things even more difficult.\n   - My keyboard (GK68XS) app. The keyboard still works, but programming it requires the Windows app.\n2. Emoji picking is just crap. The GNOME emoji picker only works on GTK apps, but the apps where I want emoji are web or electron apps, such as Twitter, Slack or Discord.\n3. Screensharing is a bit iffy. Doing so results in all my monitors shared as a single monitor. I ended up removing my extra monitors.\n4. [Cyberpunk 2077 performs noticeably worse in Linux](https://www.protondb.com/app/1091500) by many accounts, including lower framerates and more frequent crashes.\n5. Colour is very strange. Despite using the same monitor, colours look much much worse than when connected to Windows. Most notably, blues and purples.\n6. Progressive Web Apps don't seem to work properly. I like having Youtube Music as a PWA, but under Ubuntu I must run it as a Chromium tab. Under Windows, I can open the start menu, type \"yout\" and open Youtube Music seamlessly.\n7. Linux seems unable to sleep my computer - cold boots only.\n\n## Verdict\n\nI cannot use Linux as my primary OS. But I will very happily use Linux on my home server that doesn't need games or media playback.\n\n## Some other interesting people and their Linux experiences\n\nhttps://monadical.com/posts/moving-to-linux-desktop.html","lastmodified":"2022-08-31T19:02:18.376965918Z","tags":null},"/notes/My-favourite-blogs":{"title":"My favourite blogs and digital gardens","content":"\nMy personal notes are heavily inspired by the personal notes, blogs, and [digital gardens](notes/digital%20garden.md) of many others.\n\n## The ones I love the most\n\n- [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) by [Andy Matuschak](notes/Andy%20Matuschak)  is extremely enjoyable to read. He writes short notes that are easy to digest, presenting them with the  [[Sliding panes]] UI pattern for you to keep track of where you came from. He also posts long form articles on his [blog](https://andymatuschak.org/books/).\n- [Essays](https://www.gwern.net/index) by [[Gwern Branwen]] is a marvelous and unique part of the internet. Spectacularly well researched posts, that have taught me a lot about how impactful and different a well written blog post is than an atomic note, and many other things. Almost frustratingly, Gwern is almost never wrong about anything.\n - [The Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) by [Maggie Appleton](notes/Maggie%20Appleton) is **beautiful** and *insightful*. Maggie herself is a UI designer and illustrator whose work you have likely seen before, and thus her site features gorgeous [typography](notes/typography) and charming illustrations throughout.\n - [Wonderful things](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/) by Scott Hanselman I have read for many years. He posts less frequently these days, but his content stays relevant for a long time. There are a small amount of ads and sponsorships throughout but they are easy to ignore.\n - [Project Nayuki](https://www.nayuki.io/) by Nayuki is a blog that started in 2007 and is still updated with wonderfully insightful essays, mostly about computer science. The article I re-read most often is about [Tags not hierarchies](https://www.nayuki.io/page/designing-better-file-organization-around-tags-not-hierarchies), but you might want to start with why they [don't like dividends](https://www.nayuki.io/page/i-dislike-dividends).\n - [Dynomight](https://dynomight.net/) writes articles that are far better than most online magazines. The claims are interesting, the writing is long but not jargony, full of pictures and with almost excessive amounts of citations, which is a trauma response from some early commenters accusing them of not citing enough. No ads or sponsorships to be seen anywhere. The article I re-read the most is [So you're thinking about writing on the internet](https://dynomight.net/internet-writing/).\n - [Dan Luu's blog](https://danluu.com/) is a treasure trove for all nerds with an interest in computer science. He does his own research and details it all in extremely long blog posts. If you own an expensive keyboard, you should read his post about [keyboard latency](https://danluu.com/keyboard-latency/), and if you know what a command line is you should read about [terminal latency](https://danluu.com/term-latency/). Personally I find myself re-reading this the most: [95% isn't that good](https://danluu.com/p95-skill/). \n\n## Other people's notes I enjoyed browsing\n\n[[Anne-Laure Le Cunff]]'s [Mental Nodes](https://www.mentalnodes.com/about)  has an especially nice note about how [creating makes you live longer](https://www.mentalnodes.com/living-beyond-your-expiration-date).\n\n[LYT kit](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/%2B+Start+Here) by Nick Milo is  a directed set of notes to teach a person how to make a [personal knowledge management](notes/PKM) system that scales well into the future.

[[Brad Woods]]  is himself seems to be an excellent UI software engineer. Anyone with an interest in JavaScript and UI should look through his notes.\n\n[Everything I know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) by Nikita is **enormous** while remaining quite charming. Lots of emojis and links and pages. I recommend that you simply go there and explore, but if I had to pick one note it would be his note about [relationships](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/relationships/).\n\n[Tritarget](https://tritarget.org/) by Sukima has an enormous number of notes on UI engineering, particularly around [EmberJS](notes/EmberJS)\n\nJulia Evan's [blog](https://jvns.ca/) about is phenomenal, particularly for computer science. You might want to look at [Celebrate tiny milestones](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/03/13/celebrate-tiny-learning-milestones/) to start, and [Things that used to be hard that are now easy](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/02/20/things-that-used-to-be-hard-and-are-now-easy/).\n\n[Notes](https://publish.obsidian.md/eleanorkonik/) by Eleanor Konik is a wealth of information on World Building and PKM. It's made using Obsidian Publish\n\n[LOW‚ÜêTECH MAGAZINE](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/) is unique for being powered entirely by solar power. You can see the current battery level in the website's background. This blog has some excellent posts about energy and sustainable future. My favourite article is this one, [Heating people not places](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/02/heating-people-not-spaces.html)\n\n[Alexis Rondeau's digital garden](https://publish.obsidian.md/alexisrondeau/) is made with Obsidian Publish and is rich in notes.

This means you can't accidentally press the throttle while standing around\n- Not too heavy, weighs as much as 1.5 corgis, 45 pounds\n- Maintains speed as battery drains\n\n## Things that weird me out\n\n- Installing an app on your phone is **required** to unlock top speed. Others have had the novel idea to use a burner phone to install the app.[^2]\n- No way to lock it - I have to bring it with me when I reach my destination. This isn't too bad, such as when grocery shopping I can fold it and place under the shopping trolley.\n- When starting the scooter, you have to kick off quite hard. Sometimes I have to kick off twice.\n- Can't ride in the rain. With just IP54 dirt and water resistance, the manual warns it cannot ride in more than 2cm of water.\n\nOverall I'm super pleased with this - in terms of raw cost it's similar in cost to my 6700 XT graphics card, but arguably gives much more joy. \n\n[^1]: [NIU on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09C8D5FP4/?th=1\u0026psc=1) is back to $799USD at time of writing\n[^2]:  [Why do you need an app to use THIS??!? - NIU KQi3 Kick Scooter](https://youtu.be/VBCx9KSy9bI) ","lastmodified":"2022-08-31T19:02:18.380965915Z","tags":null},"/notes/PKM":{"title":"Personal Knowledge Management","content":"\nPersonal Knowledge Management (PKM) is the skill of managing one's life knowledge, secrets, and experiences so that they can be reused,  relived, and built upon to create other work. A complete system of tools and techniques for managing knowledge might also be called \"a PKM\".\n\nWe live in an age of Knowledge work rather than physical labour. If you are reading this, you are likely paid to type things on a keyboard, make gestures with a mouse, and speak into a webcam. In this age, managing large amounts of specialised information to deliver tailored information is the key to success. In such a system, I believe the keys to long term success are:\n\n- **Quick capture**. Thoughts, words, ideas, come by and disappear so quickly. The ability to capture the important ones is crucial. This means easy to use tools that are reliable and readily available.\n- **Resurfacing**. \"I wrote that down somewhere but I can't find it\" is the hallmark of a PKM that has failed. Notes must be organised in a way that facilitates rediscovery, without being a burden to maintain. You may be interested in how [my note organisation system](notes/My%20note%20organisation%20system) achieves this.\n- **Robustness**. Good notes should survive the rigour of real life. A power outage, a destroyed computer, a company bankrupting. This means making [backups that work](notes/backup).\n\n## Similar things\n\n[Digital gardens](notes/digital%20garden.md) are an extension of PKM. The knowledge in a digital garden is the personal knowledge of that digital gardener. The difference between a PKM and a digital garden is that not all a person's managed knowledge will be in the garden. Some things are always kept separate: passwords, private life, intensely personal moments, secrets. These are well managed by a PKM, but do not belong in a digital garden.\n\nWikis and company intranets have some resemblance to PKM, but have many additional challenges. They tend to be slow and lack any character, joy, or humour.","lastmodified":"2022-08-31T19:02:18.380965915Z","tags":null},"/notes/Punctuation":{"title":"Punctuation","content":"\nThe characters between words, which convey meaning that words cannot. In English, they can include:\n\n- [[Quotation marks]] such as  `‚Äú‚Äù`\n- [[Dashes]] such as `‚Äî`\n- [[Mathematical operators]]  such as `√ó`\n- [[Foot and inch marks]] `‚Ä≤`\n\nIt is common to approximate punctuation with a similar character because the real character is not available on the writer's keyboard. Some approximations I see:\n\n|                     | Approximation | Real    |\n| ------------------- | ------------- | ------- |\n| Dash                | -             | ‚Äî       |\n| trademark           | (tm)          | ‚Ñ¢       |\n| Copyright           | (c)           | ¬©       |\n| Quotation (English) | \"\"            | ‚Äú‚Äù      |\n| Foot or Prime mark  | '             | \u0026prime; |\n| Inch mark           | \"             | \u0026Prime; |\n| Multiplication      | x or *        | √ó       |\n| Division            | /             | √∑       |\n\nBut such approximations of punctuation are ugly, even problematic. Consider these two examples:\n\n\u003e \"Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.\"\u003cbr/\u003e\u0026hyphen; Oscar Wilde\n\nThe same example again with real punctuation:\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúBe yourself; everyone else is already taken.‚Äù\u003cbr/\u003e‚Äï Oscar Wilde\n\nFoot and prime marks can be especially problematic.\n- \"She‚Äôs 6' 10\".\"\n- ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs 6‚Ä≤ 10‚Ä≥.‚Äù\n\nIn particular, approximating Mathematics or Finance characters is frequently confusing. Multiplication `√ó` with the letter `x` is problematic because in maths `x` can refer to a graph axis as well as an algebraic value.\n\n## Additional reading\n\n[[Typewolf]] has possibly the best [punctuation cheatsheet](https://www.typewolf.com/cheatsheet) available anywhere, for free.\n\n[[Practical Typography]] also has an excellent [Punctuation Guide](https://practicaltypography.com/type-composition.html).\n\nIf you think you're a punctuation expert, try pasting your writing into [Just the punctuation](https://just-the-punctuation.glitch.me/), then see how it compares to other writers in this [Medium post](https://medium.com/creators-hub/what-i-learned-about-my-writing-by-seeing-only-the-punctuation-efd5334060b1).\n\n![](https://www.c82.net/images/custom/between-the-words/large/alices-adventures-in-wonderland.jpg)\n\n[Between the words](https://www.c82.net/work/?id=347) - posters of just the punctuation of major literary works such as Alice in Wonderland\n\n[Shady Characters by Keith Houston](https://www.amazon.com/Shady-Characters-Punctuation-Symbols-Typographical/dp/0393064425) looks interesting, though I haven't read it yet.\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-31T19:02:18.380965915Z","tags":null},"/notes/Quartz-by-Jacky":{"title":"Quartz","content":"\nA tool for publishing [Obsidian](notes/obsidian) to the web, and what I'm using for this note you're reading now!\n\nIt's built on top of [Hugo](notes/Hugo), which I'm told is very fast, but can be hard to use. So far I've observed builds with this tool taking around 40 seconds which is a bit slower than I'd like.

This will just appear as plain text. I requested support for these in [this ticket](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues/161).\n\n**Generic wikilinks**. Obsidian allows you to refer to a note without mentioning its path, such as `[[software engineering]]`. Quartz requires you to use Markdown links `[]()`, with a full path and URL encoding of spaces. Attempting to use wikilinks anyway will result in broken links and backlinks.\n\n**Comments**. `%% Typing something like this will appear in the published notes as plain text %%`\n\n## Other drawbacks\n- Significant technical knowledge needed. I had to install [[Golang]], Hugo, Make, add those to my environment path, just to build the website on my Windows laptop. For the tech savvy it doesn't feel like much, but this is too difficult for many people. \n- No RSS. This isn't too big a deal as I don't have any readers now, but providing an RSS feed is a way to protest the overwhelming strength and evil of social media and corporate-funded news. Jacky has teased the idea of possibly adding it in future, on the Quartz Discord.\n- Poor [[Accessibility]] for screen readers. This comes in a few forms:\n\t- The search button is not a button. This is fixed in these notes, but still a problem in the original source.\n\t- No alt text on images. Markdown supports adding some text to an image like so: `![Some alt text](link\\to\\image.jpg)`. But either Quartz or Hugo ignores it.\n\t- I may work on some of these issues myself.\n\n## Perks, or why I chose Quartz over everything else\n\nAll the words above may seem like I dislike Quartz. They only mean I know its weaknesses, and Quartz remains my preferred method for publishing notes despite the alternatives! \n\n- **Separate note titles, filenames, and link text**. One of the solutions I tried previously, Foam Research, required that note titles, filenames, and link text all be the same, and in a particular format. For instance, a Quartz link can have [any text that I desire](My%20favourite%20blogs), but a Foam link always looks like: [my-favourite-blogs](My%20favourite%20blogs), including the dashes. This was maddening!\n- **Interactive graph**. The graph you see at the bottom of the page is much more friendly than others I've tried so far, with nice hover effects, bouncy physics, and even links between neighbours!\n- **Dark mode**. I often read my own notes at night, and appreciate being able to set the theme to dark mode.\n- **Backlinks with context**. If you look at the bottom of this page you will see some backlinks that appear to have no context. But if you hover over the backlink, you'll see the sentence that refers to this page. This is amazing! [Backlinks should include context](notes/Backlinks%20should%20include%20context)!\n\n## Alternatives I didn't like, but you might\n\n- [[Obsidian Publish]], but people seem to have mixed things to say about it.\n- [Jekyll](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).

Searching for the name encourages future maintainers to explore.\n\n### Invariants or exclusions\n\nIf you have intentionally excluded something from the design, that thing should be defined along with the reason why. Future maintainers cannot know why something doesn't exist.[^3]\n\n### Diagrams\n\n![C4 diagram for internet banking system](notes/images/c4_diagram.jpg)\n\nThese might be based on the C4 model: context, containers, components, code.

I'd recommend literally any other movie by Waititi, such as Jojo Rabbit.\n\n## The good\n\nNatalie Portman as Lady Thor is absolutely stunning.\n\nThe relationship struggles between Thor and Jodie were reasonably engaging, enough for me to see some of myself in them. I can respect that a lot, and I hope to do better in my own relationship as a result. The flashbacks of their relationship may be my favourite part of the movie.\n\n## The bad\n\nThe aforementioned fights don't seem to be realistically resolved. Problem-avoidance was well portrayed, but the two seem to get back together in a way that was predictably unsatisfying.\n\nThe movie feels juvenile. It has energy much like an 80s morning cartoon. Just as I struggle to enjoy watching such cartoons today, I struggled to enjoy watching Thor Love and Thunder. Jokes are somewhat tiring and drawn out with weak payoffs. The Gods are cartoonishly evil. Dialogue and action felt cheesy. The whole movie feels mostly aimed at kids, and I'm not sure if that is done well either.\n\nAll this might be forgivable if the movie developed Thor's storyline in any meaningful way. It does not. Unlike Thor Ragnarok which made enormous changes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as adding significant beats to Thor's story, Love and Thunder leaves Thor in largely the same place he was prior to the movie, but with an added sidekick character, who for now isn't very interesting.\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-31T19:02:18.380965915Z","tags":null},"/notes/Time-timer":{"title":"Time timer","content":"![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711vrQPS8eL._SL1500_.jpg)\n\nA physical timer, which operates on a single [[AA battery]].

But the reality is a lot bigger than that.\n\nFirst of all, there are some reasons not to, so let's get those out of the way.\n\n## Why you shouldn't publish online\n\n- *Brutally unkind people*. A thoughtless comment can leave permanent imprints. Most of us have found ourselves dwelling on an unkind statement for days, weeks, or months afterward. For that reason there is no comments sections on this website. Some people I respect partially disagree: They dislike the bad comments, but endure them for the immensely valuable comments.[^2] So I may change my mind later.\n- *Crime*. People have been known to use information from social media and blogs in creatively malicious ways. Photos of a holiday to indicate the person's home is vacant for burglarising, a selfie that reveals a person's location are all clues that have been used. I've taken care to omit information that could identify me from these notes wherever possible.\n- *Time*. I'm not sure how many hours I've spent setting this website up, customising it, and writing posts, but it is surely a lot and not something I'd ask anyone else to do.\n\n## Why you should publish anyway\n\nEven with those risks in place, I've found the benefits of publishing to be far greater.\n\n- **It sharpens writing**. Before I put things online, I let myself write complete unintelligible crap that even I sometimes could not understand. Now, I'm forced to really edit, revise, and polish my words. This improves my communication in writing, at work, with friends and loved ones and beyond.\n- **It sharpens thinking**. You may have heard of the [[Feynman Learning Technique]], which states that to understand something, you should be able to express it simply. Publishing notes forces me to do this.\n- **It's fulfilling in the long term**. Activities like watching TV or playing a game often fulfil me only during the activity, leaving me very little to show for it. Writing is something I both enjoy doing and also leaves me with a useful memento of the activity.\n- **The internet depends on it**. The following blog post expresses it better than I can:\n \n\u003e **You are not blogging enough.** You are pouring your words into increasingly closed and often walled gardens. You are giving control - and sometimes ownership - of your content to social media companies that will SURELY fail. These companies are [profoundly overvalued](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-11/facebook-ipo-overvalued-at-96-billion-in-global-investors-poll.html), [don't care about permalinks](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/GooglePlusOffersASophiesChoiceToEarlyAdoptersOfGoogleAppsViaAnIncompleteTakeoutMigrationTool.aspx), [don't make your content portable](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/GooglePlusOffersASophiesChoiceToEarlyAdoptersOfGoogleAppsViaAnIncompleteTakeoutMigrationTool.aspx), and have [terms of service that are so complex and obtuse that there are entire websites dedicate to explaining them](http://tos-dr.info/).\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003e ‚Äî[[Scott Hanselman]] on [2012-August-19](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-words-are-wasted?ref=refind)\n\n[^1]: This is a [digital garden](notes/Digital%20garden), not a blog, but I knew what she meant üòä\n[^2]: [So you're thinking about writing on the internet](https://dynomight.net/internet-writing/), scroll down to \"Listening to criticism is a superpower.\"","lastmodified":"2022-08-31T19:02:18.380965915Z","tags":null},"/notes/You-should-link-your-notes":{"title":"You should link your notes","content":"\n\u003e It is not the amount of knowledge that makes a brain. It is not even the distribution of knowledge. It is the interconnectedness.\n\u003e‚Äî[[Howard Bloom]] via [[Farnam Street]]\n\nYou probably write a lot of notes already, and already have [[Reasons to write notes]]. What might not be so obvious is why you should link your notes together. Maybe you've seen a lot of hype about Roam Research, Zettelkasten, Obsidian and don't get why. Here are the reasons I link my notes, regardless of app.\n\n## Links multiply reuse, and *prevent abandonment*\n\nEven without links, I would re-read and refer to old writing. An old resume I would use as a basis for a new resume. An old report that got rave reviews I can re-purpose to make a new report. A snippet of code that I knew to work and would want to use again, but too small to warrant an entire version control system.\n\nWithout links, how many times a note got re-used tended to be limited. It's too much work to continually create new folders for notes, then crawling through those folders to look up a note to reuse it. Subconsciously I would use notes less and less, or even completely forgetting that they exist at all. I suspect the latter is *extremely* common, and undetected because it is extremely hard to realise that you have forgotten to remember something. This is a strong limitation of folders as an organisational structure, where files can only exist in a single folder. Such files put in deep folders became abandoned, never looked at again, with great regularity.\n\nWith links, I can access a file in a single click instead of twenty, which means I've found that I reuse my work perhaps 10-100 times as much as I did before. There is surely still some number of files being abandoned and forgotten, but they are far fewer now.\n\n## Links refine my writing\n\nThe reuse of my writing as a result of linking has meant I've been strongly encouraged to refine it in many ways. The simple act of linking by itself forces me to look at a note's title, encouraging me to carefully rewrite the title for better reuse. Reusing a note a few times encourages me to fix simple errors like spelling and poorly formed sentences. Some amount of more reuse encourages me to format lists, and add a hierarchy of headings. A great deal of re-use encourages me to find contrasting arguments, supporting links, images, diagrams, videos and more.\n\nThis increased quality of writing has directly contributed to my professional success and personal development. When you are the one person on a team who can write, you can lead. [[Poor writing blocks career progression|Technical writing is required for Engineering Leadership]].\n\n## Links make writing fun again\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/Ulkzt8qd4nGHRI9DdV\" width=\"480\" height=\"440\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nSomeone described my writing app of choice, [[Obsidian]], as like *playing your mind like a videogame*. I have found this to be true. The activity of just creating links between documents I've written is incredibly satisfying, even without the visceral visuals and sound effects of a videogame. Creating a working link that clicks through to valuable content on the other side has no equal. \n\nAdditionally, it allows exploring my writing through a bouncy graph visualisation, which is so much more fun than plain text.\n\n## My conversations flow better\n\nMany of us have had the feeling of thinking of the perfect punchline long after the conversation has ended. The French call this [going down the stairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27esprit_de_l%27escalier). I theorise that if you're too slow in conversation, you can become faster if you do reps of linking your thoughts together, in the form of linking notes together. Some argue that this is done better with spaced repetition, with flash cards prompting one reply, but I feel that is too rigid. In contrast, linking many notes to many other notes allows much more freedom, which is essential for flowing and unstructured conversation.\n\n## Links in journals give the illusion of superhuman memory\n\nIn my [[Daily Note|Journal]], I would write about the daily goings on, and in each snippet I would link to things. That could be something totally mundane, like:\n\n\u003e [[Mr Smith]] helped [[Mr White]] with the  [[Deployment]] of [[Our secret app]].\n\nI have written thousands of these little notes, as they happen. Later, when asked about what a person had done, I could use these links to remember what had happened, even better than that person could themselves. This gives the impression of truly superhuman memory, memory that can't be reproduced by a flesh brain. \n","lastmodified":"2022-08-31T19:02:18.380965915Z","tags":null},"/notes/backup":{"title":"Backups that work","content":"\nYou likely know what a backup is: a copy of something, stored away from the original.

Old videotapes and photos are simply lost and I've no idea where to find them\n- Stolen.

Seems common with Google accounts that post Youtube videos.\n- Deletion. Most famously, an employee at Pixar accidentally deleted Toy Story 2. An employee on maternity leave happened to have a copy[^1]\n- Ransomware - Hackers encrypt files and demanded money to decrypt them[^2]\n\n## Backups that don't work\nAny backup is better than none at all. But often, backups are flawed in risky ways.\n\n- Backups that are never tested. It's common for people to make backups, and realise on attempting to restore them that they don't work.\n- Backups that take more than 2 days to restore. It's common for people to use strange media types for their backups, and find that restoring them takes a long time.\n- Backups that perish. All media types degrade over time. USB flash drives can last up to 10 years. Optical discs written with a home disc-burner last 5‚Äì100 years.[^3] But note that disc readers only live 2-10 years.[^4]\n- Backups that are lost. USB flash drives are notorious for this, particularly because they are so small they don't have room for a written label.
