I bought this to replace my ageing R9 285, a GPU released in 2014 on a 28nm process.\n\n\n\nI paid $455.78USD for it including shipping and taxes. A little higher than I wanted, but still much better than the cryptocurrency inflated prices of a short while ago.\n\n## Shortcomings\n\n**No DLSS.** AI upsampling is a huge talking point for videogames in 2021 and 2022, particularly as gamers (including myself) want high FPS at 4K resolution which is impossibly difficult to achieve. Many games have DLSS but not FSR, thus I cannot easily use AI upsampling.\n\n## Why it's awesome\n*The 3rd most powerful GPU in the world per-watt*. Drawing just 215 watts, it delivered 112FPS average across a suite of 9 games. Compare this to the much more popular RTX 3080, which requires 333 watts but only delivered 142FPS average across the same games.[^1] Is 25% more FPS worth 54% more wattage? I think not!\n\n*Compact*. With the RTX 3000 series of cards from nvidia, gamers across the world seem to have accepted GPUs that are longer, taller, fatter, and heavier. That requires larger cases and really clever installation to support all the weight and torsion force. This 6700 XT is extremely svelte\n\n\u003c!-- Find screenshot of car with headlights --\u003e\n\n*Ray tracing!* This is my first GPU with ray tracing, which looks incredible in the games that have it, like [[Cyberpunk 2077]]. Light bounces off of multiple surfaces in realistic ways, and casts more realistic shadows and reflections. I've been told that [Quake II RTX](https://www.gog.com/game/quake_ii_rtx) has recently added support for AMD GPUs such as this and I'm eager to try!\n\n[^1]: [Graphics Card Power Consumption and Efficiency Tested](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/graphics-card-power-consumption-tested) Scroll to \"Analyzing GPU Power Use and Efficiency\" ","lastmodified":"2022-07-25T19:10:45.175468467Z","tags":null},"/notes/Advice-for-writing-better-note-titles":{"title":"Advice for writing better note titles","content":"\nGiven a page within a [PKM](notes/PKM) system, how do we write a good and useful title for it? \n\nQualities we want:\n\n- Searchability. One should be able to find a note again by searching for it's Title, rather than its contents.\n- Accuracy and Honesty. A title that doesn't reflect it's content is a form of dishonesty, and is why clickbait is so hated. [[Titles are a promise of good content]].\n- Clarity. We should be able to parse a title easily and quickly to determine if it is the note we want. Milliseconds matter.  [[Concise writing takes longer to write, but is worth it]].\n\nIt's worth being aware that the goals and process for writing titles for Notes have very little resemblance to writing [[Headline]]s for Stories, Titles for Blog Posts, or Subject Lines for Emails. It in some ways resembles writing titles for [[Essay]]s.\n\n## Guidelines (not rules)\n\n**Write the document**. Titles tend to emerge from the document as it is written. You may realise on writing the body, you cannot deliver on the promise of your original title. Changing the title then becomes obvious. You may also realise on writing the title, that no single title can encapsulate all you have written. This is a good indicator that your note should be broken apart into atomic notes.\n\n**Write in assertive positive form**. ‚ÄúX causes Y‚Äù is usually better than ‚ÄúX fails to do Z‚Äù. For example:\n\n- Bad: *Doom scrolling doesn't make you smarter*\n- Good: *Doom scrolling makes you stupid*\n\nIn writing this way you may also learn to be more assertive and sure of yourself.\n\n**Phrase unproven notes as questions**. Despite my previous advice to be assertive, if you cannot prove something beyond your own doubts, you should phrase it as a question.\n\n- Bad: *Privilege is inherited*\n- Good: *How much ability is heritable?*\n\n\u003e ‚ö† Be wary of question marks in filenames. You may have to omit them.\n\n**Use consistent and correct spelling**. I have been tempted many times to ignore spelling errors, but this will bite you in future when you attempt to use the search feature in your notes. Take the time to use a spellchecker and fix errors. For the same reason, you should use only a single region's spelling. Don't mix American and Australian English.\n\n**Consider characters you can't type**. I am unable to easily type  *‚ÄúGon√ßalo‚Äù*. So my note for such a person has an alias *‚ÄúGoncalo‚Äù*.\n\n**Look at similar notes**. One way to find them is in a [[Taxonomy of note types]]. You may notice interesting and useful conventions, such as *How To* guides beginning with the words *‚ÄúHow to‚Äì‚Äù*.\n\n## Anti guidelines\n\nThese are guidelines I've seen recommended by others, which I believe you should approach with great caution.\n\n**Move important words earlier**. What is important in one circumstance may not be in another. Consider these two sentences:\n- Front end codebases should not use Typescript\n- Typescript should not be in front end codebases\n\n*Front end codebases* is more important in the first, and *Typescript* is more important in the second. Sometimes it may be worth fussing over moving words earlier, but you can waste a great deal of time without making meaningful progress.\n\n**Arbitrary title length limits**, such as \"Keep titles under 10 words\". have been a waste of time in my experience. Yes, it can be argued there is great satisfaction in reducing a title down to a catch-phrase or concept-handle like length. Where we waste time is the number - hours can be lost musing whether the number is 10 or 12, or if a very complex title can be honed down sufficiently.\n\n**Use Numbers**. Some believe that numbers in titles makes them more interesting and assertive. I believe them to be clickbait-y and low class. Consider these examples:\n\n- 73 thoughts I had while watching Game of Thrones\n- 11 ways to build muscle and lose fat\n- Read faster in just 5 steps\n\nThey have some advantages, namely that they give you some idea of how large the note is. On the downside, they reek of lower class writing, and they are also not very Searchable. Who can remember to search for the number \"73\"? And every time we change the body we have to update the number!\n\n **Exaggerate and appeal to emotion**. There are many words that are charged excessively with emotion, to the point of being upsetting or aggravating.\n - Javascript is cancer\n - Boomer advice you need to unlearn\n\n**Name drop**. It has become popular in PKM blogs and videos lately to hijack the fame of others by mentioning their names in titles, such as [[Niklas Luhmann]], [[Sonke Ahrens]], [Andy Matuschak](notes/Andy%20Matuschak)  and so on. You should keep this to a minimum as doing this tends to stifle your own thinking.\n\n---\n\n## Other people's thoughts\n\nIn putting together this note, I read many others.

Here's a snip:\n\u003e The idea of the bi-directional link goes all the way back to 1945, when [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush) dreamed up the [[Memex]] machine. Vannevar outlined this hypothetical gadget in an essay in _The Atlantic_ called [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/). He wanted a system capable of ‚Äúassociative indexing... whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another... (so that) numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail.‚Äù\n\nZettelkasten.de says [backlinks are bad](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/backlinks-are-bad-links/):\n\u003e Backlinks are bad linking on crack and steroids. Not only do they not provide any link context other than the title, but they are placed automatically. That means that your system (executed by software or habit) provides you with more choice and therefore more cognitive load. On top, you will check the backlinks if provided and that creates opportunity costs. Reviewing the backlinks is time you don‚Äôt spend with other cognitions. You will spend _more_ time with _wasting_ time.\n\nI don't agree, but you might be interested in his article regardless.\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-25T19:10:45.175468467Z","tags":null},"/notes/Backlinks-should-include-context":{"title":"Backlinks should include context","content":"\n[Backlinks](notes/Backlink.md) are becoming increasingly popular in note taking applications, such as [[Obsidian]] and [[Notion]].

But we do not know why. Does Caitlin Floyd direct horror movies? Is Justice Fears a Horror Movie critic? Who knows!\n\n![](notes/images/notion-backlink.jpg)\n\nThe equivalent Backlink in Obsidian includes some context, like this:\n\n![obsidian backlink](notes/images/obsidian-backlink.jpg)\n\nBy supplying some context around the Backlink, we know why the link was made, and it becomes far more interesting and useful. This is so important to me, that it is part of why I chose Obsidian and Logseq over Notion, and [Quartz](notes/Quartz%20by%20Jacky) over Jekyll and Obsidian Publish.\n\nRegardless, it is also helpful for the note to have a good title so that we do not have to rely entirely on the context.

All notes are permanently a work in progress. Blogs prefer the philosophy of keeping a post exactly the same after it is published, and if it is changed, a very prominent addendum should be added. Digital gardens don't bother with this limitation, and relish making changes at the whim of the author. A signature of digital gardens of the 90s was [Under Construction GIFs](http://textfiles.com/underconstruction/).\n- **Link first organisation**. Blogs almost always to have a chronological timeline view, with recent posts at the top. A digital garden often has no such timeline, favouring Links from one post to another as a way to get around. Some even have [backlinks](notes/Backlink.md).\n- **No ads**. Digital gardens almost never have ads or sponsorships, and never bother with SEO. \n\n## Etymology of the Analogy\n\nDigital gardens were greatly motivated by the observation that simple handwritten notes tend to *rot*. Some time after they are written, the author may lose them entirely, or forget what the note means.\n\nBy contrast, a digital gardener prevents notes from rotting by treating their notes like a living thing. \n- Notes tend to begin as rough scrappy notes that need to be delicately tended to, like Seedlings. If you do not quickly refine your note into something more useful, you forget what it means and it dies, just like a seedling üå±.\n- As you tend to a note by writing in it, you form threads of thought, like branches, forming a tree üå≥.\n- A robust tree, when re-read, can lead to you thinking of new ideas, or fruit üçé. From these fruit you plant new seedlings, and the cycle continues.\n\nThe earliest occurrence of the term \"garden\" for online notes may be this 1998 essay, [Hypertext Gardens](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html).\n\n[Maggie Appleton](notes/Maggie%20Appleton) wrote and illustrated a much better analogy of digital gardens here: [Growing the Evergreens](https://maggieappleton.com/evergreens)\n\n## More reading\n\nMy digital garden is made using Obsidian and [Quartz](notes/Quartz%20by%20Jacky).

The elaborate and immense scale of the creatures and structures take much inspiration from [Berserk](notes/Berserk), which in turn is a hauntingly beautiful series with a [Bosch](notes/Hieronymus%20Bosch)-ian art style. The game's art style is well captured in this dialog:\n\n\u003e I remember when I was drawing the Undead Dragon, I submitted a design draft that depicted a dragon swarming with maggots and other gross things. Miyazaki handed it back to me saying \"This isn't dignified. Don't rely on the gross factor to portray an undead dragon. Can't you instead try to convey the deep sorrow of a magnificent beast doomed to a slow and possibly endless descent into ruin?\"\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003e ‚ÄîMasanori Waragai\n\nFor more, this article is quite fantastic: [The Boschian Horror of ‚ÄòElden Ring‚Äô](https://artreview.com/the-boschian-horror-of-elden-ring/)\n\nThe best [[Open world]] in a videogame in many years. The last few years of open world games have been full of excessive handholding and on screen guides that throttle the player's desire to explore. Elden Ring has almost no guides and both forces and encourages the player to explore. I haven't felt quite so adventurous since I played Morrowind. Writing on games made a 10 minute video talking more: [Why Exploring in Elden Ring Feels So Good](https://youtu.be/qJy8j64pTV4) \n\nThe visuals of the world and its people are all tied together with some incredible lore and worldbuilding. This [Gamespot article](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-heres-the-lore-and-history-of-the-lands-between/1100-6502537/) explains it better. If you have the time, the Elden ring lore videos by [Vaatividya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYDs_Inzkz4) are so amazing they were reposted on Elden Ring's official channel.\n\n## Not so fun things\n\nDespite the lore, the game's story or its characters have been entirely forgettable for me. I had extremely high expectations of the story given its involvement with George R. R. Martin, and could not tell you anything about it despite having 40 hours in the game.\n\nThe game balance is terrible. Enemy damage is too high, rune rewards often don't make sense. Videogamedunkey made a [video](https://youtu.be/D1H4o4FW-wA) about it.\n\nEnemy attack animations and range can be so fast and unfair it forces one style of play: defensive counterattacks.

It requires the host to and joining player to both assemble ingredients to cast a spell to join each other. This is fine, but the game also allows Enemy players to join your multiplayer session and kill you. This cannot be turned off. I wanted to enjoy Elden Ring together with a friend at the start of the game, and we were quickly slaughtered by a level 70 player. In addition, I'm told that co-op terminates when the area's boss has been defeated, requiring both players to cast the spell again.\n\nFor those playing on PC, a more traditional co-op multiplayer mode is possible with the [Seamless coop mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510).

He also posts long form articles on his [blog](https://andymatuschak.org/books/).\n- [Essays](https://www.gwern.net/index) by [[Gwern Branwen]] is a marvelous and unique part of the internet. Spectacularly well researched posts, that have taught me a lot about how impactful and different a well written blog post is than an atomic note, and many other things. Almost frustratingly, Gwern is almost never wrong about anything.\n - [The Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) by [Maggie Appleton](notes/Maggie%20Appleton) is **beautiful** and *insightful*. Maggie herself is a UI designer and illustrator whose work you have likely seen before, and thus her site features gorgeous [typography](notes/typography) and charming illustrations throughout.\n - [Wonderful things](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/) by Scott Hanselman I have read for many years. He posts less frequently these days, but his content stays relevant for a long time. There are a small amount of ads and sponsorships throughout but they are easy to ignore.\n - [Project Nayuki](https://www.nayuki.io/) by Nayuki is a blog that started in 2007 and is still updated with wonderfully insightful essays, mostly about computer science. The article I re-read most often is about [Tags not hierarchies](https://www.nayuki.io/page/designing-better-file-organization-around-tags-not-hierarchies), but you might want to start with why they [don't like dividends](https://www.nayuki.io/page/i-dislike-dividends).\n - [Dynomight](https://dynomight.net/) writes articles that are far better than most online magazines. The claims are interesting, the writing is long but not jargony, full of pictures and with almost excessive amounts of citations, which is a trauma response from some early commenters accusing them of not citing enough. No ads or sponsorships to be seen anywhere. The article I re-read the most is [So you're thinking about writing on the internet](https://dynomight.net/internet-writing/).\n - [Dan Luu's blog](https://danluu.com/) is a treasure trove for all nerds with an interest in computer science. He does his own research and details it all in extremely long blog posts. If you own an expensive keyboard, you should read his post about [keyboard latency](https://danluu.com/keyboard-latency/), and if you know what a command line is you should read about [terminal latency](https://danluu.com/term-latency/). \n\n## Other people's notes I enjoyed browsing\n\n[[Anne-Laure Le Cunff]]'s [Mental Nodes](https://www.mentalnodes.com/about)  has an especially nice note about how [creating makes you live longer](https://www.mentalnodes.com/living-beyond-your-expiration-date).\n\n[LYT kit](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/%2B+Start+Here) by Nick Milo is  a directed set of notes to teach a person how to make a [personal knowledge management](notes/PKM) system that scales well into the future.

When search is fast, it enables flow state. When search is slow or untrustworthy, people are forced to fumble through folders for information instead. Slow search is why I left Evernote. Bad search is why I avoid Confluence.\n- **Good titles**. No one can find their information again if everything is called *Untitled*. I have some [advice for writing better note titles](notes/Advice%20for%20writing%20better%20note%20titles).\n- **Note aliases**.

A complete system of tools and techniques for managing knowledge might also be called \"a PKM\".\n\nWe live in an age of Knowledge work rather than physical labour. If you are reading this, you are likely paid to type things on a keyboard, make gestures with a mouse, and speak into a webcam. In this age, managing large amounts of specialised information to deliver tailored information is the key to success. In such a system, I believe the keys to long term success are:\n\n- **Quick capture**. Thoughts, words, ideas, come by and disappear so quickly. The ability to capture the important ones is crucial. This means easy to use tools that are reliable and readily available.\n- **Resurfacing**. \"I wrote that down somewhere but I can't find it\" is the hallmark of a PKM that has failed. Notes must be organised in a way that facilitates rediscovery, without being a burden to maintain. You may be interested in how [my note organisation system](notes/My%20note%20organisation%20system) achieves this.\n- **Robustness**. Good notes should survive the rigour of real life. A power outage, a destroyed computer, a company bankrupting. This means making [backups that work](notes/backup).\n\n## Similar things\n\n[Digital gardens](notes/digital%20garden.md) are an extension of PKM. The knowledge in a digital garden is the personal knowledge of that digital gardener. The difference between a PKM and a digital garden is that not all a person's managed knowledge will be in the garden. Some things are always kept separate: passwords, private life, intensely personal moments, secrets. These are well managed by a PKM, but do not belong in a digital garden.\n\nWikis and company intranets have some resemblance to PKM, but have many additional challenges. They tend to be slow and lack any character, joy, or humour.","lastmodified":"2022-07-25T19:10:45.175468467Z","tags":null},"/notes/Quartz-by-Jacky":{"title":"Quartz","content":"\nA tool for publishing [Obsidian](notes/obsidian) to the web, and what I'm using for this note you're reading now!\n\nIt's built on top of [Hugo](notes/Hugo), which I'm told is very fast, but can be hard to use. So far I've observed builds with this tool taking around 40 seconds which is a bit slower than I'd like.

This will just appear as plain text. I requested support for these in [this ticket](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues/161).\n\n**Generic wikilinks**. Obsidian allows you to refer to a note without mentioning its path, such as `[[software engineering]]`. Quartz requires you to use Markdown links `[]()`, with a full path and URL encoding of spaces. Attempting to use wikilinks anyway will result in broken links and backlinks.\n\n**Comments**. `%% Typing something like this will appear in the published notes as plain text %%`\n\n**Callouts**. Typing `\u003e [!quote]` won't make a fancy callout. You'll have to use a regular blockquote and add a symbol yourself. Someone has already requested support for these in [this ticket](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues/80).\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Significant technical knowledge needed. I had to install [[Golang]], Hugo, Make, add those to my environment path, just to build the website on my Windows laptop. For the tech savvy it doesn't feel like much, but this is too difficult for many people. \n- No RSS. This isn't too big a deal as I don't have any readers now, but providing an RSS feed is a way to protest the overwhelming strength and evil of social media and corporate-funded news. Jacky has teased the idea of possibly adding it in future, on the Quartz Discord.\n\n## Perks, or why I chose Quartz over everything else\n\nAll the words above may seem like I dislike Quartz. They only mean I know its weaknesses, and Quartz remains my preferred method for publishing notes despite the alternatives! \n\n- **Separate note titles, filenames, and link text**. One of the solutions I tried previously, Foam Research, required that note titles, filenames, and link text all be the same, and in a particular format. For instance, a Quartz link can have [any text that I desire](My%20favourite%20blogs), but a Foam link always looks like: [my-favourite-blogs](My%20favourite%20blogs), including the dashes. This was maddening!\n- **Interactive graph**. The graph you see at the bottom of the page is much more friendly than others I've tried so far, with nice hover effects, bouncy physics, and even links between neighbours!\n- **Dark mode**. I often read my own notes at night, and appreciate being able to set the theme to dark mode.\n- **Backlinks with context**. If you look at the bottom of this page you will see some backlinks that appear to have no context. But if you hover over the backlink, you'll see the sentence that refers to this page. This is amazing! [Backlinks should include context](notes/Backlinks%20should%20include%20context)!\n\n## Alternatives I didn't like, but you might\n\n- [[Obsidian Publish]], but people seem to have mixed things to say about it.\n- [Jekyll](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).

But the reality is a lot bigger than that.\n\nFirst of all, there are some reasons not to so let's get those out of the way.\n\n## Why you shouldn't publish online\n\n- *Brutally unkind people*. A thoughtless comment can leave permanent imprints. Most of us have found ourselves dwelling on an unkind statement for days, weeks, or months afterward. For that reason there is no comments sections on this website. A person I respect disagrees, finding comments to be immensely valuable[^1], so I may change my mind later.\n- *Crime*. People have been known to use information from social media and blogs in creatively malicious ways. Photos of a holiday to indicate the person's home is vacant for burglarising, a selfie that reveals a person's location are all clues that have been used. I've taken care to omit information that could identify me from these notes wherever possible.\n- *Time*. I'm not sure how many hours I've spent setting this website up, customising it, and writing posts, but it is surely a lot and not something I'd ask anyone else to do.\n\n## Why you should anyway\n\nEven with those risks in place, I've found the benefits of publishing to far outweigh them:\n\n- **It sharpens writing**. Before I put things online, I let myself write complete unintelligible crap that even I sometimes could not understand. Now, I'm forced to really edit, revise, and polish my words. This improves my communication in writing, at work, with friends and loved ones and beyond.\n- **It sharpens thinking**. You may have heard of the [[Feynman Learning Technique]], which states that to understand something, you should be able to express it simply. Publishing notes forces me to do this.\n- **It's fulfilling in the long term**. Where activities like watching TV or playing a game often fulfil me only during the activity, writing is something I both enjoy doing and also enjoy reaping the rewards of afterward.\n- **The internet depends on it**. The following blog post expresses it better than I can:\n \n\u003e **You are not blogging enough.** You are pouring your words into increasingly closed and often walled gardens. You are giving control - and sometimes ownership - of your content to social media companies that will SURELY fail.

When the original is lost, the copy can fill its place.\n\n## Why make backups\nAccidents happen to everyone. Here are some accidents that have destroyed my data over the years:\n\n- Lost. Old videotapes and photos are simply lost and I've no idea where to find them\n- Stolen. Thieves broke a window of our car to steal a camera inside\n- Hard disk failure\n- RAID controller failure\n\nHere are some I have heard happen to others:\n\n- Account closed or deleted with no recourse. Seems common with Google accounts that post Youtube videos.\n- Deletion. Most famously, an employee at Pixar accidentally deleted Toy Story 2. An employee on maternity leave happened to have a copy[^1]\n- Ransomware - Hackers encrypt files and demanded money to decrypt them[^2]\n\n## Backups that don't work\nAny backup is better than none at all. But often, backups are flawed in risky ways.\n\n- Backups that are never tested. It's common for people to make backups, and realise on attempting to restore them that they don't work.\n- Backups that take more than 2 days to restore. It's common for people to use strange media types for their backups, and find that restoring them takes a long time.\n- Backups that perish. All media types degrade over time. USB flash drives can last up to 10 years. Optical discs written with a home disc-burner last 5‚Äì100 years.[^3] But note that disc readers only live 2-10 years.[^4]\n- Backups that are lost. USB flash drives are notorious for this, particularly because they are so small they don't have room for a written label. Cloud storage accounts can also have lost credentials, or a payment method that stops working.\n\n## Other people's backups that seem to work\n\nA big comment thread on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29978099) about backing up photos\n\n\n\n[^1]: https://www.romper.com/entertainment/toy-story-2-saved-woman-on-maternity-leave\n[^2]: [Don‚Äôt Wanna Pay Ransom Gangs?
