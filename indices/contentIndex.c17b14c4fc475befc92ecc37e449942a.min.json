One should be able to find a note again by searching for it's Title, rather than its contents.\n- Accuracy and Honesty. A title that doesn't reflect it's content is a form of dishonesty, and is why clickbait is so hated. [[Titles are a promise of good content]].\n- Clarity. We should be able to parse a title easily and quickly to determine if it is the note we want. Milliseconds matter.  [[Concise writing takes longer to write, but is worth it]].\n\nIt's worth being aware that the goals and process for writing titles for Notes have very little resemblance to writing [[Headline]]s for Stories, Titles for Blog Posts, or Subject Lines for Emails. It in some ways resembles writing titles for [[Essay]]s.\n\n## Guidelines (not rules)\n\n**Write the document**. Titles tend to emerge from the document as it is written. You may realise on writing the body, you cannot deliver on the promise of your original title. Changing the title then becomes obvious. You may also realise on writing the title, that no single title can encapsulate all you have written. This is a good indicator that your note should be broken apart into atomic notes.\n\n**Write in assertive positive form**. ‚ÄúX causes Y‚Äù is usually better than ‚ÄúX fails to do Z‚Äù. For example:\n\n- Bad: *Doom scrolling doesn't make you smarter*\n- Good: *Doom scrolling makes you stupid*\n\nIn writing this way you may also learn to be more assertive and sure of yourself.\n\n**Phrase unproven notes as questions**. Despite my previous advice to be assertive, if you cannot prove something beyond your own doubts, you should phrase it as a question.\n\n- Bad: *Privilege is inherited*\n- Good: *How much ability is heritable?*\n\n\u003e ‚ö† Be wary of question marks in filenames. You may have to omit them.\n\n**Use consistent and correct spelling**. I have been tempted many times to ignore spelling errors, but this will bite you in future when you attempt to use the search feature in your notes. Take the time to use a spellchecker and fix errors. For the same reason, you should use only a single region's spelling. Don't mix American and Australian English.\n\n**Consider characters you can't type**. I am unable to easily type  *‚ÄúGon√ßalo‚Äù*. So my note for such a person has an alias *‚ÄúGoncalo‚Äù*.\n\n**Look at similar notes**. One way to find them is in a [[Taxonomy of note types]]. You may notice interesting and useful conventions, such as *How To* guides beginning with the words *‚ÄúHow to‚Äì‚Äù*.\n\n## Anti guidelines\n\nThese are guidelines I've seen recommended by others, which I believe you should approach with great caution.\n\n**Move important words earlier**. What is important in one circumstance may not be in another. Consider these two sentences:\n- Front end codebases should not use Typescript\n- Typescript should not be in front end codebases\n\n*Front end codebases* is more important in the first, and *Typescript* is more important in the second. Sometimes it may be worth fussing over moving words earlier, but you can waste a great deal of time without making meaningful progress.\n\n**Arbitrary title length limits**, such as \"Keep titles under 10 words\". have been a waste of time in my experience. Yes, it can be argued there is great satisfaction in reducing a title down to a catch-phrase or concept-handle like length. Where we waste time is the number - hours can be lost musing whether the number is 10 or 12, or if a very complex title can be honed down sufficiently.\n\n**Use Numbers**. Some believe that numbers in titles makes them more interesting and assertive. I believe them to be clickbait-y and low class. Consider these examples:\n\n- 73 thoughts I had while watching Game of Thrones\n- 11 ways to build muscle and lose fat\n- Read faster in just 5 steps\n\nThey have some advantages, namely that they give you some idea of how large the note is. On the downside, they reek of lower class writing, and they are also not very Searchable. Who can remember to search for the number \"73\"? And every time we change the body we have to update the number!\n\n **Exaggerate and appeal to emotion**. There are many words that are charged excessively with emotion, to the point of being upsetting or aggravating.\n - Javascript is cancer\n - Boomer advice you need to unlearn\n\n**Name drop**. It has become popular in PKM blogs and videos lately to hijack the fame of others by mentioning their names in titles, such as [[Niklas Luhmann]], [[Sonke Ahrens]], [Andy Matuschak](notes/Andy%20Matuschak)  and so on. You should keep this to a minimum as doing this tends to stifle your own thinking.\n\n---\n\n## Other people's thoughts\n\nIn putting together this note, I read many others.

Vannevar outlined this hypothetical gadget in an essay in _The Atlantic_ called [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/). He wanted a system capable of ‚Äúassociative indexing... whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another... (so that) numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail.‚Äù\n\nZettelkasten.de says [backlinks are bad](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/backlinks-are-bad-links/):\n\u003e Backlinks are bad linking on crack and steroids. Not only do they not provide any link context other than the title, but they are placed automatically. That means that your system (executed by software or habit) provides you with more choice and therefore more cognitive load. On top, you will check the backlinks if provided and that creates opportunity costs. Reviewing the backlinks is time you don‚Äôt spend with other cognitions. You will spend _more_ time with _wasting_ time.\n\nI don't agree, but you might be interested in his article regardless.\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-14T20:01:58.452979468Z","tags":null},"/notes/Bear-app":{"title":"Bear","content":"A MacOS-only app for [personal knowledge management](notes/PKM).

There's so much happening in every cell, with every character, every interaction, and I seem to find more with every look.

Blogs prefer the philosophy of keeping a post exactly the same after it is published, and if it is changed, a very prominent addendum should be added. Digital gardens don't bother.\n- Organised with Links. Blogs tend to have a chronological view, emphasizing things that have been posted recently. Often a blog will also have sections or categories of posts. A digital garden favours Links from one post to another as a way to get around. Some even have [backlinks](notes/backlink.md).\n- No ads. Digital gardens almost never have ads or sponsorships, and never bother with SEO. \n\n## Etymology of the Analogy\n\nDigital gardens were greatly motivated by the observation that simple handwritten notes tend to *rot*. Some time after they are written, the author may lose them entirely, or is unable to remember what the note means.\n\nBy contrast, a digital gardener prevents notes from rotting by treating their notes like a living thing. \n- Notes tend to begin as rough scrappy notes that need to be delicately tended to, like Seedlings. If you do not quickly refine your note into something more useful, you forget what it means and it dies, just like a seedling üå±.\n- As you tend to a note by writing in it, you form threads of thought, like branches, forming a tree üå≥.\n- A robust tree, when re-read, can lead to you thinking of new ideas, or fruit üçé. From these fruit you plant new seedlings, and the cycle continues.\n\nThe earliest occurrence of the term \"garden\" for online notes may be this 1998 essay, [Hypertext Gardens](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html).\n\n[Maggie Appleton](notes/Maggie%20Appleton) wrote and illustrated a much better analogy of digital gardens here: [Growing the Evergreens](https://maggieappleton.com/evergreens)\n\n## More reading\n\nMy digital garden is made using Obsidian and [Quartz](notes/Quartz%20by%20Jacky).\n\nFor more, I might suggest [my favourite blogs and digital gardens](My%20favourite%20blogs)\n\n[Maggie Appleton](notes/Maggie%20Appleton) wrote a phenomenal essay on the topic: [A Brief History \u0026 Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).","lastmodified":"2022-07-14T20:01:58.452979468Z","tags":null},"/notes/Elden-Ring":{"title":"Elden Ring","content":"![](https://c.neevacdn.net/image/fetch/s--dOUFa4O7--/https%3A//www.thathashtagshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Elden-Ring-Cover-1024x512.jpg?savepath=Elden-Ring-Cover-1024x512.jpg)\n\nPossibly my favourite [videogame](notes/videogame) of 2022.

The elaborate and immense scale of the creatures and structures take much inspiration from [Berserk](notes/Berserk), which in turn is a hauntingly beautiful series with a [Bosch](notes/Hieronymus%20Bosch)-ian art style. The game's art style is well captured in this dialog:\n\n\u003e I remember when I was drawing the Undead Dragon, I submitted a design draft that depicted a dragon swarming with maggots and other gross things. Miyazaki handed it back to me saying \"This isn't dignified. Don't rely on the gross factor to portray an undead dragon. Can't you instead try to convey the deep sorrow of a magnificent beast doomed to a slow and possibly endless descent into ruin?\"\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003e ‚ÄîMasanori Waragai\n\nFor more, this article is quite fantastic: [The Boschian Horror of ‚ÄòElden Ring‚Äô](https://artreview.com/the-boschian-horror-of-elden-ring/)\n\nThe best [[Open world]] in a videogame in many years. The last few years of open world games have been full of excessive handholding and on screen guides that throttle the player's desire to explore. Elden Ring has almost no guides and both forces and encourages the player to explore. I haven't felt quite so adventurous since I played Morrowind. Writing on games made a 10 minute video talking more: [Why Exploring in Elden Ring Feels So Good](https://youtu.be/qJy8j64pTV4) \n\n## Not so fun things\n\nSo far, I don't care much for the game's story or its characters. I had extremely high expectations of the story given its involvement with George R. R. Martin, and could not tell you anything about it despite having 40 hours in the game.\n\nThe game balance is terrible. Enemy damage is too high, rune rewards often don't make sense. Videogamedunkey made a [video](https://youtu.be/D1H4o4FW-wA) about it.\n\nEnemy attack animations and range can be so fast and unfair it forces one style of play: defensive counterattacks. Quik Reviews made a [16 minute video](https://youtu.be/YPh0u7WaW64) - and goes on to say [Sekiro](https://www.sekirothegame.com/) has better designed bosses. This person made a [12 minute video](https://youtu.be/R9Vbsr3Ko7M) showing how unfair Malenia is.\n\nI'm playing it on PC, and am aware it runs better on Playstation 5 and looks better on a big TV. PC gamers should note the game is capped at 60FPS.\n\n## Fun things outside the game\n\n### Stuff I personally enjoyed\n\n[[Carbot Animations]] did some hilarious [spoofs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSyRf8rAjTs)\n\nBlaidd voice actor Scott Arthur reads thirst tweets in a [4 minute video](https://youtu.be/PE6wLtf7Y_0)\n\n### Stuff I haven't tried or understand\n\n#### Merchandise\n\n![](https://c.neevacdn.net/image/fetch/s--FaHOKSN3--/https%3A//top-mmo.fr/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/fmini-the-raging-wolf-05b-1653511628832.jpg?savepath=fmini-the-raging-wolf-05b-1653511628832.jpg)\n\nThere are two [[Figuarts Minis]] for Elden Ring: [Raging Wolf](https://www.tamashiinations.com/product/details.php?detail=831) and [Melina](https://www.tamashiinations.com/product/details.php?detail=832). \n\nMyself and many others are waiting for an official art book, but none have been announced at time of writing (2022-July-9)\n\n#### Glitches\n\n[[Spiffing Brit]] found that immortality is possible by dying on purpose to the game's first boss then quitting the game. More in his [24 minute video](https://youtu.be/GwBc0ixfbzI)\n\n#### Co-op\n\nElden Ring has a built in coop mode that I do not enjoy. It requires the host to and joining player to both assemble ingredients to cast a spell to join each other. This is fine, but the game also allows Enemy players to join your multiplayer session and kill you. This cannot be turned off. I wanted to enjoy Elden Ring together with a friend at the start of the game, and we were quickly slaughtered by a level 70 player. In addition, I'm told that co-op terminates when the area's boss has been defeated, requiring both players to cast the spell again.\n\nFor those playing on PC, a more traditional co-op multiplayer mode is possible with the [Seamless coop mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510). Note that it requires a new game, and does not trigger Steam achievements. Here's a video of it working!\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QeDUcf1G7YM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n#### Game Engine\n\nThis very smart person deconstructed how Elden Ring's graphics works, and in doing so also also dove deep into DirectX12: [Behind the Pretty Frames: Elden Ring](http://www.mamoniem.com/behind-the-pretty-frames-elden-ring/)\n\n## Tips for winning\n\nParrying is easier with the *buckler*  than any other shield, because it has the *Buckler Parry*.

So terrible that it drives users to alternatives, such as NextJS or [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).\n- [Hugo is great, it's documentation is not](https://sagar.se/blog/hugo-documentation/)\n - this article is also a great write up of [[Technical writing]] and [[Atomic notes]]\n\n## Testimonials\n\n### Happy\n\u003e When building a large website (kde.org has more than 1400 pages) all these features make sense. I can organize my template in directories, enjoy fast generation time, separating the templating part from the content, create SCSS files for each pages that needs a special layout. There is also a (fast) JS bundler integrated into Hugo. Afaik Zola also doesn't support i18n and Jekyll has a few plugins for that but this is not a build-in functionality.\n\u003e ‚Äî [2020-10-30](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24945745)\n\n\u003e Build times went from 10 seconds to 0.2s.\n\u003e ‚Äî [seanwilson](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24946414)\n\n\u003e it has enough built in (Sass, minifying, JavaScript bundler, image optimisation) that you just focus on site content rather than procrastinating with your build chain.\n\u003e ‚Äî [seanwilson](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24946414)\n\n### Not so happy\n\u003e My most frustrating experience with Hugo is their template language and lack of clear explanations, often waiving away any complexities as, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just Go templates.‚Äù Fair enough, but the docs make no attempt to explain how scoping works, how variables can be applied to partials, or even how to construct a simple for-loop. There‚Äôs an answer for each of these problems but implementing a full solution requires scouring through the Go docs and Hugo‚Äôs own forums for a complete and pragmatic solution.\n\u003e ‚Äî[A throwaway account](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30528827)\n\n\u003e But much like Handlebars, Go template expressions aren‚Äôt REPL friendly, and a the learning experience involves a lot of refreshing and debug output just to get a clue as to how things work.\n\u003e ‚Äî[A throwaway account](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30528827)\n\n\u003e The whole \"They Are Just Go Templates\" is a pretty pathetic cop out. Sorry, but it's true. If I'm trying to use Hugo, I don't want to be digging in Go docs at the same time, and as you point out, you can't know things like scopes and what Go variables might actually be available...I subsequently gave up on Hugo entirely and ported my Hugo sites to Next.js, which is in fact documented--and can work well with TypeScript, so complex pages are fully strongly typed, which makes work in an IDE a breeze. \n\u003e ‚Äî[SomeCallMeTim](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30533110)","lastmodified":"2022-07-14T20:01:58.452979468Z","tags":null},"/notes/Jurassic_World_Dominion":{"title":"Jurassic World: Dominion","content":"\n![](https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/original/QOMBHUrMCTw6nugUsGQdLKYxr8.jpg)\n\nThe movie feels mostly like a chaotic carnival ride.

Spoilers ahead!\n\n---\n\nClaire has been separated. After escaping an enormous dinosaur, she is finding her way back to safety, in the dark and alone. Out in the darkness she hears a sound, but it's not quite clear what it is. It repeats, longer and louder. It's playful, almost cute.\n\nIt's the whistle of a dilophosaurus. She knows all too well what that sound means.\n\nThe whistle repeats, but the sound overlaps the first. There's more than one.\n\nClaire is unarmed and surrounded by *three dilophosauruses*. She is tired and unarmed. There is no escape. To date, every single person who has heard this whistle has died. One dilophosaurus sniffs his helpless meal.\n\nChris Pratt appears and kills it. The others flee.\n\nAnd here, we have one of the core problems of the movie: \n\n## No danger\n\nThe movie is entirely unwilling to kill or even hurt any of its ‚Äúgood‚Äù characters. Being the last movie in the franchise, there wasn't much reason to keep anyone alive, yet they all survive, with only flesh scratches and scrapes. The dinosaurs appear so frequently and the characters always escape, giving us no reason at all to fear them.\n\nThere are many other things to say about this movie, but I'll leave it there.

Spectacularly well researched posts, that have taught me a lot about how impactful and different a well written blog post is than an atomic note, and many other things. Almost frustratingly, Gwern is almost never wrong about anything.\n - [The Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) by [Maggie Appleton](notes/Maggie%20Appleton) is **beautiful** and *insightful*. Maggie herself is a UI designer and illustrator whose work you have likely seen before, and thus her site features gorgeous [typography](notes/typography) and charming illustrations throughout.\n - [Wonderful things](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/) by Scott Hanselman I have read for many years.

There are a small amount of ads and sponsorships throughout but they are easy to ignore.\n - [Project Nayuki](https://www.nayuki.io/) by Nayuki is a blog that started in 2007 and is still updated with wonderfully insightful essays, mostly about computer science. The article I re-read most often is about [Tags not hierarchies](https://www.nayuki.io/page/designing-better-file-organization-around-tags-not-hierarchies), but you might want to start with why they [don't like dividends](https://www.nayuki.io/page/i-dislike-dividends).\n\n## Other people's notes I enjoyed browsing\n\n[[Anne-Laure Le Cunff]]'s [Mental Nodes](https://www.mentalnodes.com/about)  has an especially nice note about how [creating makes you live longer](https://www.mentalnodes.com/living-beyond-your-expiration-date).\n\n[LYT kit](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/%2B+Start+Here) by Nick Milo is  a directed set of notes to teach a person how to make a [personal knowledge management](notes/PKM) system that scales well into the future.

When you want to write something down, you should not need to think about *where* to write, you should just write. My journal is my default place. \n- **Search**. When search is fast, it enables flow state. When search is slow or untrustworthy, people are forced to fumble through folders for information instead. Slow search is why I left Evernote. Bad search is why I avoid Confluence.\n- **Good titles**. No one can find their information again if everything is called *Untitled*. I have some [advice for writing better note titles](notes/Advice%20for%20writing%20better%20note%20titles).\n- **Note aliases**. There may be multiple suitable titles for a note, and a good PKM system should allow all of them. This enables much more reliable searching.\n- **Links** to relevant notes, preferably also with [backlinks](notes/backlink).\n\n## All the parts of my system\n\nTo come!","lastmodified":"2022-07-14T20:01:58.452979468Z","tags":null},"/notes/PKM":{"title":"Personal Knowledge Management","content":"\nPersonal Knowledge Management (PKM) is the skill of managing one's life knowledge, secrets, and experiences so that they can be reused,  relived, and built upon to create other work. A complete system of tools and techniques for managing knowledge might also be called \"a PKM\".\n\nWe live in an age of Knowledge work rather than physical labour. If you are reading this, you are likely paid to type things on a keyboard, make gestures with a mouse, and speak into a webcam. In this age, managing large amounts of specialised information to deliver tailored information is the key to success. In such a system, I believe the keys to long term success are:\n\n- **Quick capture**. Thoughts, words, ideas, come by and disappear so quickly. The ability to capture the important ones is crucial. This means easy to use tools that are reliable and readily available.\n- **Resurfacing**. \"I wrote that down somewhere but I can't find it\" is the hallmark of a PKM that has failed. Notes must be organised in a way that facilitates rediscovery, without being a burden to maintain. You may be interested in how [my note organisation system](notes/My%20note%20organisation%20system) achieves this.\n- **Robustness**. Good notes should survive the rigour of real life. A power outage, a destroyed computer, a company bankrupting. This means making [backups that work](notes/backup).\n\n## Similar things\n\n[Digital gardens](notes/digital%20garden.md) are an extension of PKM. The knowledge in a digital garden is the personal knowledge of that digital gardener. The difference between a PKM and a digital garden is that not all a person's managed knowledge will be in the garden. Some things are always kept separate: passwords, private life, intensely personal moments, secrets. These are well managed by a PKM, but do not belong in a digital garden.\n\nWikis and company intranets have some resemblance to PKM, but have many additional challenges. They tend to be slow and lack any character, joy, or humour.","lastmodified":"2022-07-14T20:01:58.452979468Z","tags":null},"/notes/Quartz-by-Jacky":{"title":"Quartz","content":"\nA tool for publishing [Obsidian](notes/obsidian) to the web, and what I'm using for this note you're reading now!\n\nIt's built on top of [Hugo](notes/Hugo), which I'm told is very fast, but can be hard to use.

This will just appear as plain text.\n\n**Generic wikilinks**. Obsidian allows you to refer to a note without mentioning its path, such as `[[software engineering]]`. Quartz requires you to use Markdown links `[]()`, with a full path and URL encoding of spaces. Attempting to use wikilinks anyway will result in broken links and backlinks.\n\n**Comments**. `%% Typing something like this will appear in the published notes as plain text %%`\n\n**Callouts**. Typing `\u003e [!quote]` won't make a fancy callout. You'll have to use a regular blockquote and add a symbol yourself. \n\n## Drawbacks\n- Significant technical knowledge needed. I had to install [[Golang]], Hugo, Make, add those to my environment path, just to build the website on my Windows laptop. For the tech savvy it doesn't feel like much, but this is too difficult for many people. \n- No RSS. This isn't too big a deal as I don't have any readers now, but providing an RSS feed is a way to protest the overwhelming strength and evil of social media and corporate-funded news. Jacky has teased the idea of possibly adding it in future, on the Quartz Discord.\n\n[^1]: This is a footnote!

Old videotapes and photos are simply lost and I've no idea where to find them\n- Stolen. Thieves broke a window of our car to steal a camera inside\n- Hard disk failure\n- RAID controller failure\n\nHere are some I have heard happen to others:\n\n- Account closed or deleted with no recourse. Seems common with Google accounts that post Youtube videos.\n- Deletion. Most famously, an employee at Pixar accidentally deleted Toy Story 2.

But often, backups are flawed in risky ways.\n\n- Backups that are never tested. It's common for people to make backups, and realise on attempting to restore them that they don't work.\n- Backups that take more than 2 days to restore. It's common for people to use strange media types for their backups, and find that restoring them takes a long time.\n- Backups that perish. All media types degrade over time. USB flash drives can last up to 10 years. Optical discs written with a home disc-burner last 5‚Äì100 years.[^3] But note that disc readers only live 2-10 years.[^4]\n- Backups that are lost. USB flash drives are notorious for this, particularly because they are so small they don't have room for a written label.
